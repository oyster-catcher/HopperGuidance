<a name='int_whatisalglib' class='sheader'></a><h2>1.1 What is ALGLIB</h2>

<p align=justify>
ALGLIB is a cross-platform numerical analysis and data mining library.
It supports several programming languages (C++, C#, Delphi, VB.NET, Python) and several operating systems (Windows, *nix family).
</p>

<p align=justify>
ALGLIB features include: 
</p>

<ul>
<li>Data analysis (classification/regression, including neural networks)</li>
<li>Optimization and nonlinear solvers</li>
<li>Interpolation and linear/nonlinear least-squares fitting</li>
<li>Linear algebra (direct algorithms, EVD/SVD), direct and iterative linear solvers, Fast Fourier Transform and many other algorithms (numerical integration, ODEs, statistics, special functions)</li>
</ul>

<p align=justify>
ALGLIB Project (the company behind ALGLIB) delivers to you several editions of ALGLIB:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>ALGLIB Free Edition</i> - full functionality but limited performance and license</li>
<li><i>ALGLIB Commercial Edition</i> - high-performance version of ALGLIB with business-friendly license</li>
</ul>

<p align=justify>
Free Edition is a serial version without multithreading support or extensive low-level optimizations (generic C or C# code).
Commercial Edition is a heavily optimized version of ALGLIB.
It supports multithreading, it was extensively optimized, and (on Intel platforms) -
our commercial users may enjoy precompiled version of ALGLIB which internally calls Intel MKL to accelerate low-level tasks.
We obtained license from Intel corp., which allows us to integrate Intel MKL into ALGLIB, so you don't have to buy separate license from Intel.
</p>

<a name='int_license' class='sheader'></a><h2>1.2 ALGLIB license</h2>

<p align=justify>
<b>ALGLIB Free Edition</b> is distributed under license which favors non-commmercial usage,
but is not well suited for commercial applications:

<a name='gs_guide' class='sheader'></a><h2>1.4 Reference Manual and User Guide</h2>

<p>
ALGLIB Project provides two sources of information: ALGLIB Reference Manual (this document) and <a href="http://www.alglib.net/#book">ALGLIB User Guide</a>.
</p>

<p>
ALGLIB Reference Manual contains full description of all publicly accessible ALGLIB units accompanied with examples.
Reference Manual is focused on the source code: it documents units, functions, structures and so on.
If you want to know what unit <code>YYY</code> can do or what subroutines unit <code>ZZZ</code> contains Reference Manual is a place to go.
Free software needs free documentation - that's why ALGLIB Reference Manual is licensed under BSD-like documentation license.
</p>

<p>
Additionally to the Reference Manual we provide you <a href="http://www.alglib.net/#book">User Guide</a>.
User Guide is focused on more general questions: how fast ALGLIB is? how reliable it is? what are the strong and weak sides of the algorithms used?
We aim to make ALGLIB User Guide an important source of information both about ALGLIB and numerical analysis algorithms in general.
We want it to be a book about algorithms, not just software documentation.
And we want it to be unique - that's why ALGLIB User Guide is distributed under less-permissive <a href="http://alglib.net.localhost/#guide_license">personal-use-only license</a>.
</p>

<a name='gs_structure' class='sheader'></a><h1>2 ALGLIB structure</h1>

<a name='gs_osscomm' class='sheader'></a><h2>2.1 Editions</h2>

<p>
ALGLIB comes in two versions - open source (GPL-licensed) and commercial (closed source) one.
Both versions have same <i>functionality</i>, i.e. may solve same set of problems.
However, commercial version differs from open source one in following aspects:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>License</b>.
Commercial ALGLIB is licensed under non-copyleft license which is friendly to commercial users.
</li>
<li>
<b>Performance</b>.
Commercial Edition includes high-performance native computational kernels and multi-threading support.
Open source ALGLIB is single-threaded and can not efficiently use modern multicore CPU's.
It also does not include native kernels - only generic C# code.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This documentation applies to both versions of ALGLIB.
Parts specific to commercial versions are explicitly marked as such.
</p>

<a name='gs_cores' class='sheader'></a><h2>2.2 Computational cores</h2>

<p>
ALGLIB for C# has two computational cores which provide 100% identical API,
but implement it in completely different ways:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>NET core</b> - a pure C# library, 100% NET without even a bit of native code.
This core is portable wherever NET works. Commercial version of NET core includes multithreading support,
Free edition is a single-threaded library.</li>
<li><b>Native core</b> - a thin C# wrapper around high-performance native library written in C.
This core is portable only to platforms where precompiled version of the binary is available.
It is included only in the Commercial edition of ALGLIB.</li>
</ul>

<p>
So, we have two editions (Free and Commercial) and two cores (NET and native),
with native core being included only in Commercial Edition.
As result, we have three combinations of editions+cores,
each providing same functionality, but with different performance and license restrictions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Free NET core</b> - a pure C# library, 100% NET, limited performance (no multithreading/SIMD),
licensed under GPL 2+.
</li>
<li>
<b>Commercial NET core</b> - a pure C# library, 100% NET, good performance (multithreading support),
licensed under commercial license
</li>
<li>
<b>Commercial Native core</b> - a thin C# wrapper around native library,
best performance (multithreading and SIMD support),
licensed under commercial license.</li>
</ul>

<p>
NET and native cores provide 100% identical APIs.
It gives you unprecedented ability to change computational cores without changing the rest of your application.
If you need best performance, you may work with native core.
And if for some reason you need to deploy your application in the pure NET environment,
you can switch to NET core.
</p>

<a name='gs_packages' class='sheader'></a><h2>2.3 Packages</h2>

<p>
For your convenience,
ALGLIB API is divided into a set of <i>packages</i> - closely connected subsets of functions.
When you work with NET computational core, there exists one-to-one correspondence between packages and source files.
One package may rely on other ones, but we have tried to reduce number of dependencies.
Say, every package relies on <code>ap.cs</code> and many packages rely on <code>alglibinternal.cs</code>.
But many packages require only these two to work,
and many other packages need significantly less than 13 packages listed below:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>alglibmisc.cs</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;contains different algorithms which are hard to classify</li>
<li><b>dataanalysis.cs</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;contains data mining algorithms</li>
<li><b>diffequations.cs</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;contains differential equation solvers</li>
<li><b>fasttransforms.cs</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;contains FFT and other related algorithms</li>
<li><b>integration.cs</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;contains numerical integration algorithms</li>
<li><b>interpolation.cs</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;contains interpolation algorithms</li>
<li><b>linalg.cs</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;contains linear algebra algorithms</li>
<li><b>optimization.cs</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;contains optimization algorithms</li>
<li><b>solvers.cs</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;contains linear and nonlinear solvers</li>
<li><b>specialfunctions.cs</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;contains special functions</li>
<li><b>statistics.cs</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;statistics</li>
<li><i>alglibinternal.cs</i>&nbsp;-&nbsp;contains internal functions which are used by other packages, but not exposed to the external world</li>
<li><i>ap.cs</i>&nbsp;-&nbsp;contains publicly accessible vector/matrix classes, most important and general functions and other "basic" functionality</li>
</ul>

<p>
Native version of ALGLIB for C# is a monolithic library (one native binary + one C# wrapper file),
but still it uses same division as NET one.
</p>

<a name='gs_subpackages' class='sheader'></a><h2>2.4 Subpackages</h2>

<p>
There is one more concept to learn - <i>subpackages</i>.
If you look at the <a href='#alglib_main'>list of ALGLIB packages</a>, you will see that each package includes several subpackages.
For example, <code>linalg.cs</code> includes <code>trfac</code>, <code>svd</code>, <code>evd</code> and other subpackages.
These subpackages do not exist as separate files, namespaces or other entities.
They are just subsets of one large file, one large class, which provide significantly different functionality.
They have separate documentation sections, but if you want to use <code>svd</code> subpackage,
you have to compile <code>linalg.cs</code>, not <code>svd.cs</code>.
</p>

<a name='gs_compatibility' class='sheader'></a><h1>3 Compatibility</h1>

<p>
NET computational core is compatible with:
</p>

<ul>
<li>any kind of optimization settings</li>
<li>any CPU which supports .NET (including ARM processors)</li>
<li>both Microsoft-provided implementation of .NET framework (2.0 or higher) and open source implementation of .NET (Mono).</li>
<li>any C# compiler which support C# 2.0 or later (MS C# compiler or Mono C# compiler)</li>
<li>any OS where .NET framework exists</li>
</ul>

<p>
Native computational core is compatible with:
</p>

<ul>
<li>32-bit and 64-bit Windows OS, working on x86/x64 processors</li>
<li>Linux working on x64 (x86 is not supported)</li>
</ul>

<a name='gs_compiling' class='sheader'></a><h1>4 Compiling ALGLIB</h1>

<a name='gs_attaching' class='sheader'></a><h2>4.1 Adding to your project</h2>

<p>
Adding ALGLIB to your project is easy - just pick packages you need and... add them to your project!
It will work without any additional settings.
</p>

<p>
As you see, ALGLIB has no project files. Why? There are several reasons:
</p>

<ul>
<li>first, because many ALGLIB users don't need separate shared library - they prefer to integrate source code in their projects.
We have provided script-based build system before, but majority of our users prefer to build ALGLIB themselves.
</li>
<li>
second, because we want ALGLIB to be usable in any programming environment, whether it is Visual Studio or Mono.
The best solution is to write package which doesn't depend on any particular programming environment.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
In any case, compiling ALGLIB is so simple that even without project file you can do it in several minutes.
</p>

<a name='gs_using' class='sheader'></a><h1>5 Using ALGLIB</h1>


<a name='gs_using_threadsafety' class='sheader'></a><h2>5.1 Thread-safety</h2>

<p>
Both open source and commercial versions of ALGLIB are 100% thread-safe
<b>as long as different user threads work with different instances of objects/arrays</b>.
Thread-safety is guaranteed by having no global shared variables.
</p>

<p>
However, <b>any kind</b> of sharing ALGLIB objects/arrays between different threads is potentially hazardous.
Even when this object is <b>seemingly</b> used in read-only mode!
</p>

<p class='p_note'>
Say, you use ALGLIB neural network <i>NET</i> to process two input vectors <i>X0</i> and <i>X1</i>,
and get two output vectors <i>Y0</i> and <i>Y1</i>.
You may decide that neural network is used in read-only mode which does not change state of <i>NET</i>,
because output is written to distinct arrays <i>Y</i>.
Thus, you may want to process these vectors from parallel threads.
<br><br>
But it is <b>not</b> read-only operation, even if it looks like this!
Neural network object <i>NET</i> allocates internal temporary buffers, which are modified by neural processing functions.
Thus, sharing one instance of neural network between two threads is thread-unsafe!
</p>

<a name='gs_global' class='sheader'></a><h2>5.2 ALGLIB classes</h2>

<p>
All ALGLIB functionality is provided by one large class - <code>alglib</code>.
</p>

<a name='gs_datatypes' class='sheader'></a><h2>5.3 Datatypes</h2>

<p>
ALGLIB defines several "basic" datatypes (types which are used across many packages) and many package-specific datatypes.
"Basic" datatypes are defined in <code>ap.cs</code>.
Here is short list:
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>alglib.complex</code>&nbsp;-&nbsp;double precision complex datatype, which supports arithmetic operations</li>
<li><code>alglib.alglibexception</code>&nbsp;-&nbsp;exception which is thrown by library</li>
<li><code>alglib.ndimensional_func</code>&nbsp;-&nbsp;delegate used by optimizers/solvers</li>
<li><code>alglib.ndimensional_grad</code>&nbsp;-&nbsp;delegate used by optimizers/solvers</li>
<li><code>alglib.ndimensional_hess</code>&nbsp;-&nbsp;delegate used by optimizers/solvers</li>
<li><code>alglib.ndimensional_jac</code>&nbsp;-&nbsp;delegate used by optimizers/solvers</li>
<li><code>alglib.ndimensional_pfunc</code>&nbsp;-&nbsp;delegate used by optimizers/solvers</li>
<li><code>alglib.ndimensional_pgrad</code>&nbsp;-&nbsp;delegate used by optimizers/solvers</li>
<li><code>alglib.ndimensional_phess</code>&nbsp;-&nbsp;delegate used by optimizers/solvers</li>
<li><code>alglib.ndimensional_rep</code>&nbsp;-&nbsp;delegate used by optimizers/solvers</li>
<li><code>alglib.ndimensional_ode_rp</code>&nbsp;-&nbsp;delegate used by ODE solver</li>
<li><code>alglib.integrator1_func</code>&nbsp;-&nbsp;delegate used by 1-dimensional integrator</li>
</ul>

<p>
Package-specific datatypes are classes which can be divided into two distinct groups:
</p>

<ul>
<li>"struct-like" classes with public fields</li>
<li>"object-like" classes which have no public fields. You should use ALGLIB functions to work with them.</li>
</ul>

<a name='gs_makecopy' class='sheader'></a><h2>5.4 Copying ALGLIB objects</h2>

<p>
Most objects in ALGLIB (optimizers, neural networks and so on) have <code>make_copy()</code> member function
which creates a copy of the object.
This function is defined in parent class <code>alglib.alglibobject</code> and is overridden in classes which inherit from it.
Thus, return type of this function is <code>alglib.alglibobject</code>, i.e. you should explicitly cast it to actial type of the object being copied.
</p>

<a name='gs_stdfunctions' class='sheader'></a><h2>5.5 Functions</h2>

<p>
The most important "basic" functions from <code>alglib</code> class are:
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>alglib.math.randomreal()</code>&nbsp;-&nbsp;returns random real number from [0,1)</li>
<li><code>alglib.math.randominteger(mx)</code>&nbsp;-&nbsp;returns random integer number from [0,nx)</li>
<li><code>alglib.math.sqr(x)</code>&nbsp;-&nbsp;returns square of real x</li>
<li><code>alglib.math.csqr(z)</code>&nbsp;-&nbsp;returns square of complex z</li>
<li><code>alglib.math.conj(z)</code>&nbsp;-&nbsp;returns conjugate of complex z</li>
<li><code>alglib.math.abscomplex(z)</code>&nbsp;-&nbsp;returns magnitude of complex z</li>
</ul>

<a name='gs_functions' class='sheader'></a><h2>5.6 Using functions: 'expert' and 'friendly' interfaces</h2>

<p>
Most ALGLIB functions provide two interfaces: 'expert' and 'friendly'. What is the difference between two? When you use 'friendly' interface, ALGLIB:
</p>

<ul>
<li>tries to automatically determine size of input arguments</li>
<li>throws an exception when arguments have inconsistent size (for example, square matrix is expected, but non-square is passed;
another example - two parameters must have same size, but have different size)</li>
<li>if semantics of input parameter assumes that it is symmetric/Hermitian matrix,
checks that lower triangle is equal to upper triangle (conjugate of upper triangle) and throws an exception otherwise</li>
<li>if semantics of output parameter assumes that it is symmetric/Hermitian matrix,
returns full matrix (both upper and lower triangles)</li>
</ul>

<p>
When you use 'expert' interface, ALGLIB:
</p>

<ul>
<li>requires caller to explicitly specify size of input arguments.
If vector/matrix is larger than size being specified (say, N), only N leading elements are used</li>
<li>if semantics of input parameter assumes that it is symmetric/Hermitian matrix,
uses <i>only upper or lower triangle</i> of input matrix and requires caller <i>to specify what triangle to use</i></li>
<li>if semantics of output parameter assumes that it is symmetric/Hermitian matrix, returns only upper or lower triangle
(when you look at specific function, it is clear what triangle is returned)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here are several examples of 'friendly' and 'expert' interfaces:
</p>

<pre class='p_example'>
double[] x = new double[]{0,1,2,3};
double[] y = new double[]{1,5,3,9};

<a name='gs_comm' class='sheader'></a><h1>6 Working with commercial version</h1>

<a name='gs_comm_benefits' class='sheader'></a><h2>6.1 Benefits of commercial version</h2>

<p>
Commercial version of ALGLIB for C# features three important improvements over open source one:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>License</b>.
Commercial license used by ALGLIB is friendly to closed source applications.
Unlike GPL, it does not require you to open source your application.
Thus, almost any commercial software developer is interested in obtaining commercial license.
</li>
<li>
<b>Multithreading</b>.
Commercial version of ALGLIB can utilize multicore capabilities of modern CPU's.
Large computational problems can be automatically split between different cores.
ALGLIB uses its own multithreading framework based on <code>System.Threading.Thread</code> class.
It gives ALGLIB unprecedented portability across .NET versions (any version of framework starting from .NET 2.0 is supported).
</li>
<li>
<b>High-performance native core</b>.
Commercial version of ALGLIB for C# includes two computational cores: 100% managed core and highly optimized native one.
Both cores have same functionality and identical interface, but they differ in their performance.
Managed core is written in pure C# and can be used in 100% managed environment.
Native core is written in C, supports multithreading, it was compiled with best optimization settings and linked with Intel MKL -
high performance linear algebra and FFT library from Intel.
We obtained license from Intel which allows us to integrate MKL into ALGLIB distribution.
On large-scale computational problems native computational core can be from 2x to 4x times faster than the managed one.
</li>
</ul>

<a name='gs_comm_smp' class='sheader'></a><h2>6.2 Using multithreading</h2>

<p>
Commercial version of ALGLIB includes out-of-the-box support for multithreading.
Many (<i>not all</i>) computationally intensive problems can be solved in multithreaded mode.
You should read comments on specific ALGLIB functions to determine what can be multithreaded and what can not.
</p>

<p>
ALGLIB implementation of multithreading framework uses <code>System.Threading.Thread</code> class to parallelize execution,
so it <b>does not</b> depend on presense of .NET Task Parallel Library on your system.
</p>

<p>
If you want to use multithreaded capabilities of ALGLIB, you should:
</p>

<ol>
<li>activate multithreading at global level with <code>alglib.setglobalthreading</code> function call
or enable it at per-function basis by passing <code>alglib.parallel</code> to the specific computational function</li>
<li>optionally, tell ALGLIB about number of worker threads to use (default is to utilize all cores)</li>
</ol>

<p>
Let explain it in more details...
</p>

<p>
<b>1</b>.
By default, ALGLIB is configured to perform all calculations in the serial manner.
Parallel execution can be manually enabled at either global or per-function level.
Former means that <u>all</u> ALGLIB functions will be able to parallelize themselves at their discretion.
Similarly, you can enable global parallelism, but selectively disable it for specific function calls.
</p>

<p>
Global parallelism is enabled by <code>alglib.setglobalthreading(alglib.parallel)</code> and
disabled by <code>alglib.setglobalthreading(alglib.serial)</code> calls.
Function-level parallelism can be enabled (or disabled, if global default is to parallelize)
by adding <code>alglib.parallel</code> (or <code>alglib.serial</code>) to the end of the parameters list
of the specific ALGLIB function being called.
</p>

<p>
Enabling parallelism does not guarantee that ALGLIB will parallelize its computations.
Small problems (say, products of 64x64 matrices) can not be efficiently parallelized.
ALGLIB will automatically decide whether your problem is large enough or not for efficient parallelization.
</p>

<p>
<b>2</b>.
ALGLIB automatically determines number of cores on application startup.
By default, ALGLIB uses all available cores.
Such behavior may be changed with <code>setnworkers()</code> call:
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>alglib.setnworkers(0)</code>  = use all cores</li>
<li><code>alglib.setnworkers(-1)</code> = leave one core unused</li>
<li><code>alglib.setnworkers(-2)</code> = leave two cores unused</li>
<li><code>alglib.setnworkers(+2)</code> = use 2 cores (even if you have more)</li>
</ul>

<p>
You may want to specify maximum number of worker threads during compile time
by means of preprocessor definition <code>AE_NWORKERSX</code> (say, AE_NWORKERS2, AE_NWORKERS4, AE_NWORKERS5).
You can add this definition to compiler command line or change corresponding project settings in your IDE.
Here X can be any positive number up to 16.
ALGLIB will use exactly X worker threads, unless being told to use less by <code>setnworkers()</code> call.
</p>

<a name='gs_comm_smp' class='sheader'></a><h3>6.2.1 SMT (CMT/hyper-threading) issues</h3>

<p>
<i>Simultaneous multithreading (SMT)</i> also known as <i>Hyper-threading</i> (Intel)
and <i>Cluster-based Multithreading</i> (AMD)
is a CPU design where several (usually two) <i>logical</i> cores share resources of one <i>physical</i> core.
Say, on dual-core system with 2x HT scale factor you will see 4 logical cores.
Each pair of these 4 cores, however, share same hardware resources.
Thus, you may get only marginal speedup when running highly optimized software which fully utilizes CPU resources.
</p>

<p>
Say, if one thread occupies floating-point unit,
another thread on the same physical core may work with integer numbers at the same time without any performance penalties.
In this case you may get some speedup due to having additional cores.
But if both threads keep FPU unit 100% busy, they won't get <i>any</i> multithreaded speedup.
</p>

<p>
So, if 2 math-intensive threads are dispatched by OS scheduler to different physical cores,
you will get 2x speedup due to use of multithreading.
But if these threads are dispatched to different logical cores - but same physical core - you won't get any speedup at all!
One physical core will be 100% busy, and another one will be 100% idle.
From the other side, if you start four threads instead of two, your system will be 100% utilized independently of thread scheduling details.
</p>

<p>
Let we stress it one more time - multithreading speedup on SMT systems is highly dependent on number of threads you are running and decisions made by OS scheduler.
<b>It is not 100% deterministic!</b>
With "true SMP" when you run 2 threads, you get 2x speedup (or 1.95, or 1.80 - it depends on algorithm, but this factor is always same).
With SMT when you run 2 threads you may get your 2x speedup - or no speedup at all.
Modern OS schedulers do a good job on single-socket hardware,
but even in this "simple" case they give no guarantees of fair distribution of hardware resources.
And things become a bit tricky when you work with multi-socket hardware.
<b>On SMT systems the only guaranteed way to 100% utilize your CPU is to create as many worker threads as there are logical cores</b>.
In this case OS scheduler has no chance to make its work in a wrong way.
</p>

<a name='gs_comm_native' class='sheader'></a><h2>6.3 Using native computational core</h2>

<a name='gs_comm_native_intro' class='sheader'></a><h3>6.3.1 Introduction</h3>

<p>
Commercial version of ALGLIB for C# includes high-performance native computational core.
It supports multithreading and it was linked with Intel MKL - highly optimized linear algebra and FFT library from Intel.
Many ALGLIB functions are accelerated by MKL.
</p>

<p>
Native core provides same functionality as managed one and has 100% identical interface.
It allows you to switch between native and managed cores as you wish.
You may choose portability of fully managed code - or high performance of native core.
You may change cores during application development - without ever changing code which calls ALGLIB!
</p>

<p>
As of ALGLIB 3.13.0, HPC core supports following software/hardware platforms:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows, x86</li>
<li>Windows, x64</li>
<li>Linux, x64</li>
</ul>

<a name='gs_comm_native_link' class='sheader'></a><h3>6.3.2 Linking with native core</h3>

<p>
Native computational core is located in the <code>native-core</code> subdirectory of the ALGLIB distribution.
This directory contains following files:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>bin-windows-intel/alglib32_hpc.dll</code> - 32-bit native DLL which includes
C version of ALGLIB compiled with best optimization settings and linked with Intel MKL
(MKL is statically linked and included in resulting DLL)
</li>
<li>
<code>bin-windows-intel/alglib64_hpc.dll</code> - 64-bit native DLL with same functionality
</li>
<li>
<code>bin-linux-intel/alglib64_hpc.so</code> - 64-bit native SO with same functionality, for Linux platform
</li>
<li>
<code>alglib_hpc.cs</code> - C# wrapper file which automatically detects platform we are running on (x86 or x64, Windows or Linux)
and loads appropriate DLL/SO (32-bit or 64-bit one).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
First step is to add C# wrapper file <code>alglib_hpc.cs</code> to your project.
Just compile it with the rest of your application as one more unit.
This wrapper provides exactly same set of classes and methods as managed version of ALGLIB.
However, all method calls are silently redirected to native library,
and all ALGLIB objects now wrappers around native data structures.
</p>

<p class='p_att'>
IMPORTANT: you will have to allow "unsafe" code in your application in order to compile ALGLIB wrapper layer.
In can be done by specifying <code>"/unsafe+"</code> at command line -
or by changing appropriate field in your project settings.
</p>

<p>
ALGLIB native core is automatically loaded during first call of any ALGLIB function.
Wrapper layer detects platform it is running on (x86 or x64) and chooses appropriate DLL/SO
(32-bit or 64-bit one).
Thus your application can be easily moved between 32-bit and 64-bit hosts without recompilation.
</p>

<p class='p_note'>
ALGLIB native core is automatically loaded during first call of ALGLIB functions,
but you may enforce this process by calling <code>alglib.activatealglibcore</code> method.
It can be useful if you running some kind of benchmark -
or just want to perform all "heavy" initialization during application startup.
</p>

<p>
Because HPC ALGLIB is a wrapper around native shared library, this library must always accompany your application.
Wrapper layer tries to find native libs in the application's home directory.
It works well for "standalone" executables,
but this method may fail when wrapper is a part of assembly which was placed to the GAC.
In such cases you may manually specify path to ALGLIB native core by calling <code>alglib.addsearchpath</code> method.
This method must be called prior to first call of ALGLIB functions.
</p>

<p>
After all steps above are done you may start using commercial version of ALGLIB!
</p>

<a name='gs_comm_native_diff' class='sheader'></a><h3>6.3.3 HPC core vs. Managed core</h3>

<p>
It was told before that HPC core provides same functionality as its managed counterpart.
It means that any application developed with managed core will work with HPC core.
However, there are several notable difference between two cores.
In this section we will outline these differences.
</p>

<p>
<b>Performance</b>. HPC core has better performance on large-scale problems (2x-4x improvement for most tasks),
but it is less suited for small-scale computational problems.
Say, calling HPC linear algebra functions involves copying of managed input arrays to unmanaged memory -
and similar extraction of result from unmanaged memory back to managed world.
Performance impact is negligible when you work with 1000x1000 matrices (multiplying them takes much longer then copying them),
but if you want to multiply 3x3 matrices - you will get better results with managed core,
which performs all work in managed memory.
</p>

<p>
<b>Reproducibility of numerical results</b>.
When your NET application works with floating point data, it may produce a bit different results on different computers.
It is normal situation which is caused by presence of rounding errors, which may have different magnitudes on different machines.
Same situation can be observed with HPC and managed ALGLIB cores - same algorithm may produce <i>a bit</i> different results in different computational cores.
Again, it is not algorithmic error, it just consequence of the fact that CPU works with finite-precision numbers.
</p>

<a name='gs_comm_unmanaged_memory' class='sheader'></a><h3>6.3.4 Deallocating unmanaged memory</h3>

<p>
Consider situation when you create ALGLIB object which internally allocates large chunk of ALGLIB-controlled memory,
and then you destroy this object.
</p>

<pre class='p_code_head'>
Working with large data
</pre>
<pre class='p_code_body'>

alglib.kdtree tree;
alglib.kdtreebuild(<i>onegigabyteofdata</i>, ..., <b>out</b> tree); // Pass 1GB of data to object
tree = null;                                          // Destroy object

</pre>

<p>
What will managed and native versions of ALGLIB do after last line?
Pure NET version of ALGLIB stores all its data in managed memory and it will handle this situation just as normal NET application.
Gigabyte-sized memory chunk will be forgotten and reclaimed later during garbage collection.
What is most important, NET framework <i>will be aware</i> that we have 1GB of memory which waits to be collected.
</p>

<p>
However, situation is different with HPC ALGLIB.
This version of ALGLIB stores data in the unmanaged memory.
In HPC ALGLIB, <code>kdtree</code> object stores just opaque pointer to unmanaged data structures.
One gigabyte of data is copied to unmanaged memory, where it is controlled by ALGLIB -
and NET garbage collector is <i>no longer aware about this 1GB-sized block</i>.
It knows about ALGLIB object which is responsible for this data block,
but from the GC's point of view, size of this object is 8 bytes (size of pointer).
It has no way of knowing about large data structures hidden behind this pointer.
</p>

<p>
Of course, <i>this memory won't leak</i>.
After last line <code>kdtree</code> object will become candidate for the next garbage collection run.
It has destructor which will be called during garbage collection,
so ALGLIB will be able to free all memory it is responsible for.
The problem is that you don't know <i>when</i> it will be done.
Because GC does not know about actual size of ALGLIB object,
it may decide that we do not have to perform garbage collection right now.
So it may be beneficial to enforce GC run, as demonstrated below:
</p>

<pre class='p_code_head'>
Working with large data : solution #1 (bad)
</pre>
<pre class='p_code_body'>

alglib.kdtree tree;
alglib.kdtreebuild(<i>onegigabyteofdata</i>, ..., <b>out</b> tree); // Pass 1GB of data to object
tree = null;                                          // Destroy object
System.GC.Collect();                                  // Enforce immediate GC

</pre>

<p>
Such solution works in many cases.
However, because GC is unaware about actual size of <code>tree</code> object,
sometimes it may decide to put such tiny object (8 bytes!) on hold until the next run.
And next.
And next.
Official documentation from Microsoft says that <code>GC.Collect</code> collects <i>all</i> objects,
but in practice some objects can survive GC run (it depends on GC configuration, OS version and GC load profile).
In fact, some high-performance long running C# application may start collecting
large queue of unfinalized objects waiting for their finalizers to be called.
Furthermore, manually calling <code>GC.Collect()</code> may confuse garbage collector and lead to performance degradation.
</p>

<p>
To handle such situations, HPC ALGLIB includes special method: <code>alglib.deallocateimmediately</code>,
which enforces immediate deallocation of internal data structures owned by ALGLIB object.
After method was called on ALGLIB object, all its memory is released and object becomes unusable.
In managed edition of ALGLIB this method does nothing, just sets variable it accepts to null.
</p>

<pre class='p_code_head'>
Working with large data : solution #2 (good)
</pre>
<pre class='p_code_body'>

alglib.kdtree tree;
alglib.kdtreebuild(<i>onegigabyteofdata</i>, ..., <b>out</b> tree); // Pass 1GB of data to object
alglib.deallocateimmediately(ref tree);               // deallocated and set to null

</pre>

<p>
Another option is to utilize <code>IDisposable</code> interface which is supported by ALGLIB objects since version 3.14.0:
</p>

<pre class='p_code_head'>
Working with large data : solution #3 (also good)
</pre>
<pre class='p_code_body'>

alglib.kdtree tree;
alglib.kdtreebuild(<i>onegigabyteofdata</i>, ..., <b>out</b> tree); // Pass 1GB of data to object
using(tree)
{
    do_something(tree);
} // tree is automatically deallocated at the end of the block

</pre>

<a name='gs_advanced' class='sheader'></a><h1>7 Advanced topics</h1>

<a name='gs_testing' class='sheader'></a><h2>7.1 Testing ALGLIB</h2>

<p>
There are three test suites in ALGLIB: computational tests, interface tests, extended tests.
Computational tests are located in <code>/tests/test_c.cs</code>.
They are focused on numerical properties of algorithms, stress testing and "deep" tests (large automatically generated problems).
They require significant amount of time to finish (tens of minutes).
</p>

<p>
Interface tests are located in <code>/tests/test_i.cs</code>.
These tests are focused on ability to correctly pass data between computational core and caller, ability to detect simple problems in inputs,
and on ability to at least compile ALGLIB with your compiler.
They are very fast (about a minute to finish including compilation time).
</p>

<p>
Extended tests are located in <code>/tests/test_x.cs</code>.
These tests are focused on testing some special properties
(say, testing that cloning object indeed results in 100% independent copy being created)
and performance of several chosen algorithms.
</p>

<p>
Running test suite is easy - just
</p>

<ol>
<li>compile one of these files (<code>test_c.cs</code> or <code>test_i.cs</code> or <code>test_x.cs</code>) along with the rest of the library</li>
<li>launch executable you will get. It may take from several seconds (interface tests) to several minutes (computational tests) to get final results</li>
</ol>

<p>
However, there are no strong reasons to launch tests before using ALGLIB. It was tested with many different compiler settings,
and the very nature of .NET framework and its inherent portability allows us to say that ALGLIB for .NET will work on any system.
</p>

<a name='gs_largearrays' class='sheader'></a><h2>7.2 Working with VERY large arrays</h2>

<p>
Sometimes ALGLIB users have to work with very large computational problems.
For example, RBF interpolation problem with 400.000 points may require several gigabytes of memory for temporary variables (mostly for sparse matrix of coefficients).
The problem is that .NET framework has limitations on array size even on 64-bit systems:
1) array size must be less than 2GB,
2) maximum index in any single dimension is about 2^31,
3) maximum number of elements in array is <i>UInt32MaxValue</i>.
</p>

<p>
The most important restriction is <i>(1)</i> - 2GB limit on array size.
Say, for double precision values we can not have array with more than 2^28 (about 268.000.000) elements,
which is 8 times smaller than limitation imposed by <i>(2)</i> and <i>(3)</i>.
</p>

<p>
However, NET 4.5 has ability to allocate arrays larger than 2GB (with all other restrictions being present).
In order to do so you have to use <code>gcAllowVeryLargeObjects=true</code> in your configuration schema.
With this setting turned on you can allocate double precision arrays with up to 2^31 elements,
which use up to 16GB of memory.
</p>

Airy function

Solution of the differential equation

y&quot;(x) = xy.

The function returns the two independent solutions Ai, Bi
and their first derivatives Ai'(x), Bi'(x).

Evaluation is by power series summation for small x,
by rational minimax approximations for large x.



ACCURACY:
Error criterion is absolute when function &lt;= 1, relative
when function &gt; 1, except * denotes relative error criterion.
For large negative x, the absolute error increases as x^1.5.
For large positive x, the relative error increases as x^1.5.

Integration on a finite interval [A,B].
Integrand have integrable singularities at A/B.

F(X) must diverge as &quot;(x-A)^alpha&quot; at A, as &quot;(B-x)^beta&quot; at B,  with known
alpha/beta (alpha&gt;-1, beta&gt;-1).  If alpha/beta  are  not known,  estimates
from below can be used (but these estimates should be greater than -1 too).

One  of  alpha/beta variables (or even both alpha/beta) may be equal to 0,
which means than function F(x) is non-singular at A/B. Anyway (singular at
bounds or not), function F(x) is supposed to be continuous on (A,B).

Fast-convergent algorithm based on a Gauss-Kronrod formula is used. Result
is calculated with accuracy close to the machine precision.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    A, B    -   interval boundaries (A&lt;B, A=B or A&gt;B)
    Alpha   -   power-law coefficient of the F(x) at A,

Singular value decomposition of a bidiagonal matrix (extended algorithm)

COMMERCIAL EDITION OF ALGLIB:

  ! Commercial version of ALGLIB includes one  important  improvement   of
  ! this function, which can be used from C++ and C#:
  ! * Intel MKL support (lightweight Intel MKL is shipped with ALGLIB)
  !
  ! Intel MKL gives approximately constant  (with  respect  to  number  of
  ! worker threads) acceleration factor which depends on CPU  being  used,
  ! problem  size  and  &quot;baseline&quot;  ALGLIB  edition  which  is  used   for
  ! comparison.
  !
  ! Generally, commercial ALGLIB is several times faster than  open-source
  ! generic C edition, and many times faster than open-source C# edition.
  !
  ! Multithreaded acceleration is NOT supported for this function.
  !
  ! We recommend you to read 'Working with commercial version' section  of
  ! ALGLIB Reference Manual in order to find out how to  use  performance-
  ! related features provided by commercial edition of ALGLIB.

The algorithm performs the singular value decomposition  of  a  bidiagonal
matrix B (upper or lower) representing it as B = Q*S*P^T, where Q and  P -
orthogonal matrices, S - diagonal matrix with non-negative elements on the
main diagonal, in descending order.

The  algorithm  finds  singular  values.  In  addition,  the algorithm can
calculate  matrices  Q  and P (more precisely, not the matrices, but their
product  with  given  matrices U and VT - U*Q and (P^T)*VT)).  Of  course,
matrices U and VT can be of any type, including identity. Furthermore, the
algorithm can calculate Q'*C (this product is calculated more  effectively
than U*Q,  because  this calculation operates with rows instead  of matrix
columns).

The feature of the algorithm is its ability to find  all  singular  values
including those which are arbitrarily close to 0  with  relative  accuracy
close to  machine precision. If the parameter IsFractionalAccuracyRequired
is set to True, all singular values will have high relative accuracy close
to machine precision. If the parameter is set to False, only  the  biggest
singular value will have relative accuracy  close  to  machine  precision.
The absolute error of other singular values is equal to the absolute error
of the biggest singular value.

Input parameters:
    D       -   main diagonal of matrix B.
                Array whose index ranges within [0..N-1].
    E       -   superdiagonal (or subdiagonal) of matrix B.
                Array whose index ranges within [0..N-2].
    N       -   size of matrix B.
    IsUpper -   True, if the matrix is upper bidiagonal.
    IsFractionalAccuracyRequired -
                THIS PARAMETER IS IGNORED SINCE ALGLIB 3.5.0
                SINGULAR VALUES ARE ALWAYS SEARCHED WITH HIGH ACCURACY.
    U       -   matrix to be multiplied by Q.
                Array whose indexes range within [0..NRU-1, 0..N-1].
                The matrix can be bigger, in that case only the  submatrix
                [0..NRU-1, 0..N-1] will be multiplied by Q.
    NRU     -   number of rows in matrix U.
    C       -   matrix to be multiplied by Q'.
                Array whose indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..NCC-1].
                The matrix can be bigger, in that case only the  submatrix
                [0..N-1, 0..NCC-1] will be multiplied by Q'.
    NCC     -   number of columns in matrix C.
    VT      -   matrix to be multiplied by P^T.
                Array whose indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..NCVT-1].
                The matrix can be bigger, in that case only the  submatrix
                [0..N-1, 0..NCVT-1] will be multiplied by P^T.
    NCVT    -   number of columns in matrix VT.

Output parameters:
    D       -   singular values of matrix B in descending order.
    U       -   if NRU&gt;0, contains matrix U*Q.
    VT      -   if NCVT&gt;0, contains matrix (P^T)*VT.
    C       -   if NCC&gt;0, contains matrix Q'*C.

Result:
    True, if the algorithm has converged.
    False, if the algorithm hasn't converged (rare case).

NOTE: multiplication U*Q is performed by means of transposition to internal
      buffer, multiplication and backward transposition. It helps to avoid
      costly columnwise operations and speed-up algorithm.

Additional information:
    The type of convergence is controlled by the internal  parameter  TOL.
    If the parameter is greater than 0, the singular values will have
    relative accuracy TOL. If TOL&lt;0, the singular values will have
    absolute accuracy ABS(TOL)*norm(B).
    By default, |TOL| falls within the range of 10*Epsilon and 100*Epsilon,
    where Epsilon is the machine precision. It is not  recommended  to  use
    TOL less than 10*Epsilon since this will  considerably  slow  down  the
    algorithm and may not lead to error decreasing.

History:
    * 31 March, 2007.
        changed MAXITR from 6 to 12.

This structure  is used to store results of the agglomerative hierarchical
clustering (AHC).

Following information is returned:

* TerminationType - completion code:
  * 1   for successful completion of algorithm
  * -5  inappropriate combination of  clustering  algorithm  and  distance
        function was used. As for now, it  is  possible  only when  Ward's
        method is called for dataset with non-Euclidean distance function.
  In case negative completion code is returned,  other  fields  of  report
  structure are invalid and should not be used.

* NPoints contains number of points in the original dataset

* Z contains information about merges performed  (see below).  Z  contains
  indexes from the original (unsorted) dataset and it can be used when you
  need to know what points were merged. However, it is not convenient when
  you want to build a dendrograd (see below).

* if  you  want  to  build  dendrogram, you  can use Z, but it is not good
  option, because Z contains  indexes from  unsorted  dataset.  Dendrogram
  built from such dataset is likely to have intersections. So, you have to
  reorder you points before building dendrogram.
  Permutation which reorders point is returned in P. Another representation
  of  merges,  which  is  more  convenient for dendorgram construction, is
  returned in PM.

* more information on format of Z, P and PM can be found below and in the
  examples from ALGLIB Reference Manual.

FORMAL DESCRIPTION OF FIELDS:
    NPoints         number of points
    Z               array[NPoints-1,2],  contains   indexes   of  clusters
                    linked in pairs to  form  clustering  tree.  I-th  row
                    corresponds to I-th merge:
                    * Z[I,0] - index of the first cluster to merge
                    * Z[I,1] - index of the second cluster to merge
                    * Z[I,0]&lt;Z[I,1]
                    * clusters are  numbered  from 0 to 2*NPoints-2,  with
                      indexes from 0 to NPoints-1 corresponding to  points
                      of the original dataset, and indexes from NPoints to
                      2*NPoints-2  correspond  to  clusters  generated  by
                      subsequent  merges  (I-th  row  of Z creates cluster
                      with index NPoints+I).

                    IMPORTANT: indexes in Z[] are indexes in the ORIGINAL,
                    unsorted dataset. In addition to  Z algorithm  outputs
                    permutation which rearranges points in such  way  that
                    subsequent merges are  performed  on  adjacent  points
                    (such order is needed if you want to build dendrogram).
                    However,  indexes  in  Z  are  related  to   original,
                    unrearranged sequence of points.

    P               array[NPoints], permutation which reorders points  for
                    dendrogram  construction.  P[i] contains  index of the
                    position  where  we  should  move  I-th  point  of the
                    original dataset in order to apply merges PZ/PM.

    PZ              same as Z, but for permutation of points given  by  P.
                    The  only  thing  which  changed  are  indexes  of the
                    original points; indexes of clusters remained same.

    MergeDist       array[NPoints-1], contains distances between  clusters
                    being merged (MergeDist[i] correspond to merge  stored
                    in Z[i,...]):
                    * CLINK, SLINK and  average  linkage algorithms report
                      &quot;raw&quot;, unmodified distance metric.
                    * Ward's   method   reports   weighted   intra-cluster
                      variance, which is equal to ||Ca-Cb||^2 * Sa*Sb/(Sa+Sb).
                      Here  A  and  B  are  clusters being merged, Ca is a
                      center of A, Cb is a center of B, Sa is a size of A,
                      Sb is a size of B.

    PM              array[NPoints-1,6], another representation of  merges,
                    which is suited for dendrogram construction. It  deals
                    with rearranged points (permutation P is applied)  and
                    represents merges in a form which different  from  one
                    used by Z.
                    For each I from 0 to NPoints-2, I-th row of PM represents
                    merge performed on two clusters C0 and C1. Here:
                    * C0 contains points with indexes PM[I,0]...PM[I,1]
                    * C1 contains points with indexes PM[I,2]...PM[I,3]
                    * indexes stored in PM are given for dataset sorted
                      according to permutation P
                    * PM[I,1]=PM[I,2]-1 (only adjacent clusters are merged)
                    * PM[I,0]&lt;=PM[I,1], PM[I,2]&lt;=PM[I,3], i.e. both
                      clusters contain at least one point
                    * heights of &quot;subdendrograms&quot; corresponding  to  C0/C1
                      are stored in PM[I,4]  and  PM[I,5].  Subdendrograms
                      corresponding   to   single-point   clusters    have
                      height=0. Dendrogram of the merge result has  height
                      H=max(H0,H1)+1.

NOTE: there is one-to-one correspondence between merges described by Z and
      PM. I-th row of Z describes same merge of clusters as I-th row of PM,
      with &quot;left&quot; cluster from Z corresponding to the &quot;left&quot; one from PM.

  !   (C++ and C# versions, x86/x64 platform)
  !
  ! We recommend you to read 'Working with commercial version' section  of
  ! ALGLIB Reference Manual in order to find out how to  use  performance-

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    XY      -   array[NPoints,NFeatures], dataset
    NPoints -   number of points, &gt;=0
    NFeatures-  number of features, &gt;=1
    DistType-   distance function:
                *  0    Chebyshev distance  (L-inf norm)
                *  1    city block distance (L1 norm)
                *  2    Euclidean distance  (L2 norm, non-squared)
                * 10    Pearson correlation:
                        dist(a,b) = 1-corr(a,b)
                * 11    Absolute Pearson correlation:
                        dist(a,b) = 1-|corr(a,b)|
                * 12    Uncentered Pearson correlation (cosine of the angle):
                        dist(a,b) = a'*b/(|a|*|b|)
                * 13    Absolute uncentered Pearson correlation
                        dist(a,b) = |a'*b|/(|a|*|b|)
                * 20    Spearman rank correlation:
                        dist(a,b) = 1-rankcorr(a,b)
                * 21    Absolute Spearman rank correlation
                        dist(a,b) = 1-|rankcorr(a,b)|

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    D       -   array[NPoints,NPoints], distance matrix
                (full matrix is returned, with lower and upper triangles)

NOTE:  different distance functions have different performance penalty:
       * Euclidean or Pearson correlation distances are the fastest ones
       * Spearman correlation distance function is a bit slower
       * city block and Chebyshev distances are order of magnitude slower

       The reason behing difference in performance is that correlation-based
       distance functions are computed using optimized linear algebra kernels,
       while Chebyshev and city block distance functions are computed using
       simple nested loops with two branches at each iteration.

      indexes returned in Rep.Z/PZ/PM. Either you work  with  hierarchical
      representation of the dataset (dendrogram), or you work with  &quot;flat&quot;
      representation returned by this function.  Each  of  representations
      has its own clusters indexing system (former uses [0, 2*NPoints-2]),
      while latter uses [0..K-1]), although  it  is  possible  to  perform
      conversion from one system to another by means of CZ array, returned
      by this function, which allows you to convert indexes stored in CIdx
      to the numeration system used by Rep.Z.

NOTE: this subroutine is optimized for moderate values of K. Say, for  K=5
      it will perform many times faster than  for  K=100.  Its  worst-case
      performance is O(N*K), although in average case  it  perform  better
      (up to O(N*log(K))).

This function performs agglomerative hierarchical clustering

  ! COMMERCIAL EDITION OF ALGLIB:
  !
  ! Commercial Edition of ALGLIB includes following important improvements
  ! of this function:
  ! * high-performance native backend with same C# interface (C# version)
  ! * multithreading support (C++ and C# versions)
  ! * hardware vendor (Intel) implementations of linear algebra primitives
  !   (C++ and C# versions, x86/x64 platform)
  !
  ! We recommend you to read 'Working with commercial version' section  of
  ! ALGLIB Reference Manual in order to find out how to  use  performance-
  ! related features provided by commercial edition of ALGLIB.

NOTE: Agglomerative  hierarchical  clustering  algorithm  has two  phases:
      distance matrix calculation and clustering  itself. Only first phase
      (distance matrix  calculation)  is  accelerated  by  Intel  MKL  and
      multithreading. Thus, acceleration is significant only for medium or
      high-dimensional problems.

      Although activating multithreading gives some speedup  over  single-
      threaded execution, you  should  not  expect  nearly-linear  scaling
      with respect to cores count.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    S       -   clusterizer state, initialized by ClusterizerCreate()

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    Rep     -   clustering results; see description of AHCReport
                structure for more information.

NOTE 1: hierarchical clustering algorithms require large amounts of memory.
        In particular, this implementation needs  sizeof(double)*NPoints^2
        bytes, which are used to store distance matrix. In  case  we  work
        with user-supplied matrix, this amount is multiplied by 2 (we have
        to store original matrix and to work with its copy).

        For example, problem with 10000 points  would require 800M of RAM,
        even when working in a 1-dimensional space.

NOTE: k-means clustering  algorithm has two  phases:  selection of initial
      centers and clustering  itself.  ALGLIB  parallelizes  both  phases.
      Parallel version is optimized for the following  scenario: medium or
      high-dimensional problem (8 or more dimensions) with large number of
      points and clusters. However, some speed-up  can  be  obtained  even
      when assumptions above are violated.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    S       -   clusterizer state, initialized by ClusterizerCreate()
    K       -   number of clusters, K&gt;=0.
                K  can  be  zero only when algorithm is called  for  empty
                dataset,  in   this   case   completion  code  is  set  to
                success (+1).
                If  K=0  and  dataset  size  is  non-zero,  we   can   not
                meaningfully assign points to some center  (there  are  no
                centers because K=0) and  return  -3  as  completion  code
                (failure).

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    Rep     -   clustering results; see description of KMeansReport
                structure for more information.

NOTE 1: k-means  clustering  can  be  performed  only  for  datasets  with
        Euclidean  distance  function.  Algorithm  will  return   negative
        completion code in Rep.TerminationType in case dataset  was  added
        to clusterizer with DistType other than Euclidean (or dataset  was
        specified by distance matrix instead of explicitly given points).

NOTE 2: by default, k-means uses non-deterministic seed to initialize  RNG
        which is used to select initial centers. As  result,  each  run of
        algorithm may return different values. If you  need  deterministic
        behavior, use ClusterizerSetSeed() function.

                *  2    Euclidean distance  (L2 norm), non-squared
                * 10    Pearson correlation:
                        dist(a,b) = 1-corr(a,b)
                * 11    Absolute Pearson correlation:
                        dist(a,b) = 1-|corr(a,b)|
                * 12    Uncentered Pearson correlation (cosine of the angle):
                        dist(a,b) = a'*b/(|a|*|b|)
                * 13    Absolute uncentered Pearson correlation
                        dist(a,b) = |a'*b|/(|a|*|b|)
                * 20    Spearman rank correlation:
                        dist(a,b) = 1-rankcorr(a,b)
                * 21    Absolute Spearman rank correlation
                        dist(a,b) = 1-|rankcorr(a,b)|

NOTE 1: different distance functions have different performance penalty:
        * Euclidean or Pearson correlation distances are the fastest ones
        * Spearman correlation distance function is a bit slower
        * city block and Chebyshev distances are order of magnitude slower

        The reason behing difference in performance is that correlation-based
        distance functions are computed using optimized linear algebra kernels,
        while Chebyshev and city block distance functions are computed using
        simple nested loops with two branches at each iteration.

NOTE 2: different clustering algorithms have different limitations:
        * agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms may be used with
          any kind of distance metric
        * k-means++ clustering algorithm may be used only  with  Euclidean
          distance function
        Thus, list of specific clustering algorithms you may  use  depends
        on distance function you specify when you set your dataset.

This  function  sets  seed  which  is  used to initialize internal RNG. By
default, deterministic seed is used - same for each run of clusterizer. If
you specify non-deterministic  seed  value,  then  some  algorithms  which
depend on random initialization (in current version: k-means)  may  return
slightly different results after each run.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    S       -   clusterizer state, initialized by ClusterizerCreate()
    Seed    -   seed:
                * positive values = use deterministic seed for each run of
                  algorithms which depend on random initialization
                * zero or negative values = use non-deterministic seed

1-dimensional complex convolution.

For given A/B returns conv(A,B) (non-circular). Subroutine can automatically
choose between three implementations: straightforward O(M*N)  formula  for
very small N (or M), overlap-add algorithm for  cases  where  max(M,N)  is
significantly larger than min(M,N), but O(M*N) algorithm is too slow,  and
general FFT-based formula for cases where two previois algorithms are  too
slow.

Algorithm has max(M,N)*log(max(M,N)) complexity for any M/N.

INPUT PARAMETERS
    A   -   array[0..M-1] - complex function to be transformed
    M   -   problem size
    B   -   array[0..N-1] - complex function to be transformed
    N   -   problem size

OUTPUT PARAMETERS
    R   -   convolution: A*B. array[0..N+M-2].

NOTE:
    It is assumed that A is zero at T&lt;0, B is zero too.  If  one  or  both
functions have non-zero values at negative T's, you  can  still  use  this
subroutine - just shift its result correspondingly.

    M       -   problem size

OUTPUT PARAMETERS
    R       -   cross-correlation, array[0..N+M-2]:
                * positive lags are stored in R[0..N-1],
                  R[i] = sum(pattern[j]*signal[i+j]
                * negative lags are stored in R[N..N+M-2],
                  R[N+M-1-i] = sum(pattern[j]*signal[-i+j]

NOTE:
    It is assumed that pattern domain is [0..M-1].  If Pattern is non-zero
on [-K..M-1],  you can still use this subroutine, just shift result by K.

Decision forest training report.

=== training/oob errors ==================================================

Following fields store training set errors:
* relclserror           -   fraction of misclassified cases, [0,1]
* avgce                 -   average cross-entropy in bits per symbol
* rmserror              -   root-mean-square error
* avgerror              -   average error
* avgrelerror           -   average relative error

Out-of-bag estimates are stored in fields with same names, but &quot;oob&quot; prefix.

For classification problems:
* RMS, AVG and AVGREL errors are calculated for posterior probabilities

For regression problems:
* RELCLS and AVGCE errors are zero

=== variable importance ==================================================

Following fields are used to store variable importance information:

* topvars               -   variables ordered from the most  important  to
                            less  important  ones  (according  to  current
                            choice of importance raiting).
                            For example, topvars[0] contains index of  the
                            most important variable, and topvars[0:2]  are
                            indexes of 3 most important ones and so on.

* varimportances        -   array[nvars], ratings (the  larger,  the  more
                            important the variable  is,  always  in  [0,1]
                            range).
                            By default, filled  by  zeros  (no  importance
                            ratings are  provided  unless  you  explicitly
                            request them).
                            Zero rating means that variable is not important,
                            however you will rarely encounter such a thing,
                            in many cases  unimportant  variables  produce
                            nearly-zero (but nonzero) ratings.

Variable importance report must be EXPLICITLY requested by calling:
* dfbuildersetimportancegini() function, if you need out-of-bag Gini-based
  importance rating also known as MDI  (fast to  calculate,  resistant  to
  overfitting  issues,   but   has   some   bias  towards  continuous  and
  high-cardinality categorical variables)
* dfbuildersetimportancetrngini() function, if you need training set Gini-
  -based importance rating (what other packages typically report).
* dfbuildersetimportancepermutation() function, if you  need  permutation-
  based importance rating also known as MDA (slower to calculate, but less
  biased)
* dfbuildersetimportancenone() function,  if  you  do  not  need  importance
  ratings - ratings will be zero, topvars[] will be [0,1,2,...]

Different importance ratings (Gini or permutation) produce  non-comparable
values. Although in all cases rating values lie in [0,1] range, there  are
exist differences:
* informally speaking, Gini importance rating tends to divide &quot;unit amount
  of importance&quot;  between  several  important  variables, i.e. it produces
  estimates which roughly sum to 1.0 (or less than 1.0, if your  task  can
  not be solved exactly). If all variables  are  equally  important,  they
  will have same rating,  roughly  1/NVars,  even  if  every  variable  is
  critically important.
* from the other side, permutation importance tells us what percentage  of
  the model predictive power will be ruined  by  permuting  this  specific
  variable. It does not produce estimates which  sum  to  one.  Critically
  important variable will have rating close  to  1.0,  and  you  may  have
  multiple variables with such a rating.

More information on variable importance ratings can be found  in  comments
on the dfbuildersetimportancegini() and dfbuildersetimportancepermutation()
functions.

This function performs binary compression of the decision forest.

Original decision forest produced by the  forest  builder  is stored using
64-bit representation for all numbers - offsets, variable  indexes,  split
points.

It is possible to significantly reduce model size by means of:
* using compressed  dynamic encoding for integers  (offsets  and  variable
  indexes), which uses just 1 byte to store small ints  (less  than  128),
  just 2 bytes for larger values (less than 128^2) and so on
* storing floating point numbers using 8-bit exponent and 16-bit mantissa

As  result,  model  needs  significantly  less  memory (compression factor
depends on  variable and class counts). In particular:
* NVars&lt;128   and NClasses&lt;128 result in 4.4x-5.7x model size reduction
* NVars&lt;16384 and NClasses&lt;128 result in 3.7x-4.5x model size reduction

Such storage format performs lossless compression  of  all  integers,  but
compression of floating point values (split values) is lossy, with roughly
0.01% relative error introduced during rounding. Thus, we recommend you to
re-evaluate model accuracy after compression.

Another downside  of  compression  is  ~1.5x reduction  in  the  inference
speed due to necessity of dynamic decompression of the compressed model.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    DF      -   decision forest built by forest builder

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    DF      -   replaced by compressed forest

RESULT:
    compression factor (in-RAM size of the compressed model vs than of the
    uncompressed one), positive number larger than 1.0

This subroutine builds decision forest according to current settings using
dataset internally stored in the builder object. Dense algorithm is used.

NOTE: this   function   uses   dense  algorithm  for  forest  construction
      independently from the dataset format (dense or sparse).

NOTE: forest built with this function is  stored  in-memory  using  64-bit
      data structures for offsets/indexes/split values. It is possible  to
      convert  forest  into  more  memory-efficient   compressed    binary
      representation.  Depending  on  the  problem  properties,  3.7x-5.7x
      compression factors are possible.

      The downsides of compression are (a) slight reduction in  the  model
      accuracy and (b) ~1.5x reduction in  the  inference  speed  (due  to
      increased complexity of the storage format).

      See comments on dfbinarycompression() for more info.

Default settings are used by the algorithm; you can tweak  them  with  the
help of the following functions:
* dfbuildersetrfactor() - to control a fraction of the  dataset  used  for
  subsampling
* dfbuildersetrandomvars() - to control number of variables randomly chosen
  for decision rule creation

This  function  tells  decision  forest  construction  algorithm  to   use
out-of-bag version of Gini variable importance estimation (also  known  as
OOB-MDI).

This version of importance estimation algorithm analyzes mean decrease  in
impurity (MDI) on out-of-bag sample during splits. The result  is  divided
by impurity at the root node in order to produce estimate in [0,1] range.

Such estimates are fast to calculate and resistant to  overfitting  issues
(thanks to the  out-of-bag  estimates  used). However, OOB Gini rating has
following downsides:
* there exist some bias towards continuous and high-cardinality categorical
  variables
* Gini rating allows us to order variables by importance, but it  is  hard
  to define importance of the variable by itself.

NOTE: informally speaking, MDA (permutation importance) rating answers the
      question  &quot;what  part  of  the  model  predictive power is ruined by
      permuting k-th variable?&quot; while MDI tells us &quot;what part of the model
      predictive power was achieved due to usage of k-th variable&quot;.

      Thus, MDA rates each variable independently at &quot;0 to 1&quot;  scale while
      MDI (and OOB-MDI too) tends to divide &quot;unit  amount  of  importance&quot;
      between several important variables.

      If  all  variables  are  equally  important,  they  will  have  same
      MDI/OOB-MDI rating, equal (for OOB-MDI: roughly equal)  to  1/NVars.
      However, roughly  same  picture  will  be  produced   for  the  &quot;all
      variables provide information no one is critical&quot; situation  and for
      the &quot;all variables are critical, drop any one, everything is ruined&quot;
      situation.

      Contrary to that, MDA will rate critical variable as ~1.0 important,
      and important but non-critical variable will  have  less  than  unit
      rating.

NOTE: quite an often MDA and MDI return same results. It generally happens
      on problems with low test set error (a few  percents  at  most)  and
      large enough training set to avoid overfitting.

      The difference between MDA, MDI and OOB-MDI becomes  important  only
      on &quot;hard&quot; tasks with high test set error and/or small training set.

This version of importance estimation algorithm analyzes mean increase  in
out-of-bag sum of squared  residuals  after  random  permutation  of  J-th
variable. The result is divided by error computed with all variables being
perturbed in order to produce R-squared-like estimate in [0,1] range.

Such estimate  is  slower to calculate than Gini-based rating  because  it
needs multiple inference runs for each of variables being studied.

ALGLIB uses parallelized and highly  optimized  algorithm  which  analyzes
path through the decision tree and allows  to  handle  most  perturbations
in O(1) time; nevertheless, requesting MDA importances may increase forest
construction time from 10% to 200% (or more,  if  you  have  thousands  of
variables).

However, MDA rating has following benefits over Gini-based ones:
* no bias towards specific variable types

  &quot;0 to 1&quot; scale (contrary to Gini-based rating, which returns comparative

      If  all  variables  are  equally  important,  they  will  have  same
      MDI/OOB-MDI rating, equal (for OOB-MDI: roughly equal)  to  1/NVars.
      However, roughly  same  picture  will  be  produced   for  the  &quot;all
      variables provide information no one is critical&quot; situation  and for
      the &quot;all variables are critical, drop any one, everything is ruined&quot;
      situation.

      Contrary to that, MDA will rate critical variable as ~1.0 important,
      and important but non-critical variable will  have  less  than  unit
      rating.

NOTE: quite an often MDA and MDI return same results. It generally happens
      on problems with low test set error (a few  percents  at  most)  and
      large enough training set to avoid overfitting.

      The difference between MDA, MDI and OOB-MDI becomes  important  only
      on &quot;hard&quot; tasks with high test set error and/or small training set.

This function serializes data structure to string.

Important properties of s_out:
* it contains alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, minus signs
* these symbols are grouped into words, which are separated by spaces
  and Windows-style (CR+LF) newlines
* although  serializer  uses  spaces and CR+LF as separators, you can 
  replace any separator character by arbitrary combination of spaces,
  tabs, Windows or Unix newlines. It allows flexible reformatting  of
  the  string  in  case you want to include it into text or XML file. 
  But you should not insert separators into the middle of the &quot;words&quot;
  nor you should change case of letters.
* s_out can be freely moved between 32-bit and 64-bit systems, little
  and big endian machines, and so on. You can serialize structure  on
  32-bit machine and unserialize it on 64-bit one (or vice versa), or
  serialize  it  on  SPARC  and  unserialize  on  x86.  You  can also 
  serialize  it  in  C++ version of ALGLIB and unserialize in C# one, 
  and vice versa.

Complex dense linear solver for A*x=b with complex N*N A  given  by its LU
decomposition and N*1 vectors x and b. This is  &quot;slow-but-robust&quot;  version
of  the  complex  linear  solver  with  additional  features   which   add
significant performance overhead. Faster version  is  CMatrixLUSolveFast()
function.

Algorithm features:
* automatic detection of degenerate cases
* O(N^2) complexity
* condition number estimation

No iterative refinement is provided because exact form of original matrix
is not known to subroutine. Use CMatrixSolve or CMatrixMixedSolve  if  you
need iterative refinement.

IMPORTANT: ! this function is NOT the most efficient linear solver provided
           ! by ALGLIB. It estimates condition  number  of  linear system,
           ! which results in 10-15x  performance  penalty  when  compared
           ! with &quot;fast&quot; version which just calls triangular solver.
           !
           ! This performance penalty is insignificant  when compared with
           ! cost of large LU decomposition.  However,  if you  call  this
           ! function many times for the same  left  side,  this  overhead
           ! BECOMES significant. It  also  becomes significant for small-
           ! scale problems.
           !
           ! In such cases we strongly recommend you to use faster solver,
           ! CMatrixLUSolveFast() function.

INPUT PARAMETERS
    LUA     -   array[0..N-1,0..N-1], LU decomposition, CMatrixLU result
    P       -   array[0..N-1], pivots array, CMatrixLU result
    N       -   size of A
    B       -   array[0..N-1], right part

OUTPUT PARAMETERS
    Info    -   return code:
                * -3    matrix is very badly conditioned or exactly singular.

* no additional time-consuming features, just triangular solver

INPUT PARAMETERS
    LUA     -   array[0..N-1,0..N-1], LU decomposition, CMatrixLU result
    P       -   array[0..N-1], pivots array, CMatrixLU result
    N       -   size of A
    B       -   array[0..N-1], right part

OUTPUT PARAMETERS
    Info    -   return code:
                * -3    matrix is exactly singular (ill conditioned matrices
                        are not recognized).
                * -1    N&lt;=0 was passed
                *  1    task is solved
    B       -   array[N]:
                * info&gt;0    =&gt;  overwritten by solution
                * info=-3   =&gt;  filled by zeros

NOTE: unlike  CMatrixLUSolve(),  this   function   does   NOT   check  for
      near-degeneracy of input matrix. It  checks  for  EXACT  degeneracy,
      because this check is easy to do. However,  very  badly  conditioned
      matrices may went unnoticed.

No iterative refinement  is provided because exact form of original matrix
is not known to subroutine. Use CMatrixSolve or CMatrixMixedSolve  if  you
need iterative refinement.

IMPORTANT: ! this function is NOT the most efficient linear solver provided
           ! by ALGLIB. It estimates condition  number  of  linear system,
           ! which  results  in  significant  performance   penalty   when
           ! compared with &quot;fast&quot;  version  which  just  calls  triangular
           ! solver.
           !
           ! This performance penalty is especially apparent when you  use
           ! ALGLIB parallel capabilities (condition number estimation  is
           ! inherently  sequential).  It   also   becomes significant for
           ! small-scale problems.
           !
           ! In such cases we strongly recommend you to use faster solver,
           ! CMatrixLUSolveMFast() function.

Dense solver for A*X=B with N*N symmetric positive definite matrix A given

Algorithm features:

IMPORTANT: ! this function is NOT the most efficient linear solver provided
           ! by ALGLIB. It estimates condition  number  of  linear system,
           ! which  results  in  significant  performance   penalty   when
           ! compared with &quot;fast&quot;  version  which  just  calls  triangular
           ! solver. Amount of  overhead  introduced  depends  on  M  (the
           ! larger - the more efficient).
           !
           ! This performance penalty is insignificant  when compared with
           ! cost of large LU decomposition.  However,  if you  call  this
           ! function many times for the same  left  side,  this  overhead
           ! BECOMES significant. It  also  becomes significant for small-
           ! scale problems (N&lt;50).
           !
           ! In such cases we strongly recommend you to use faster solver,
           ! SPDMatrixCholeskySolveMFast() function.

This function initializes subspace iteration solver. This solver  is  used
to solve symmetric real eigenproblems where just a few (top K) eigenvalues
and corresponding eigenvectors is required.

This solver can be significantly faster than  complete  EVD  decomposition
in the following case:
* when only just a small fraction  of  top  eigenpairs  of dense matrix is
  required. When K approaches N, this solver is slower than complete dense
  EVD
* when problem matrix is sparse (and/or is not known explicitly, i.e. only
  matrix-matrix product can be performed)

USAGE (explicit dense/sparse matrix):
1. User initializes algorithm state with eigsubspacecreate() call
2. [optional] User tunes solver parameters by calling eigsubspacesetcond()
   or other functions
3. User  calls  eigsubspacesolvedense() or eigsubspacesolvesparse() methods,
   which take algorithm state and 2D array or alglib.sparsematrix object.

USAGE (out-of-core mode):
1. User initializes algorithm state with eigsubspacecreate() call
2. [optional] User tunes solver parameters by calling eigsubspacesetcond()
   or other functions
3. User activates out-of-core mode of  the  solver  and  repeatedly  calls
   communication functions in a loop like below:
   &gt; alglib.eigsubspaceoocstart(state)
   &gt; while alglib.eigsubspaceooccontinue(state) do
   &gt;     alglib.eigsubspaceoocgetrequestinfo(state, out RequestType, out M)
   &gt;     alglib.eigsubspaceoocgetrequestdata(state, out X)
   &gt;     [calculate  Y=A*X, with X=R^NxM]
   &gt;     alglib.eigsubspaceoocsendresult(state, in Y)
   &gt; alglib.eigsubspaceoocstop(state, out W, out Z, out Report)

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimensionality, N&gt;0
    K       -   number of top eigenvector to calculate, 0&lt;K&lt;=N.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

NOTE: if you solve many similar EVD problems you may  find  it  useful  to
      reuse previous subspace as warm-start point for new EVD problem.  It
      can be done with eigsubspacesetwarmstart() function.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State       -   solver structure
    Eps         -   eps&gt;=0,  with non-zero value used to tell solver  that
                    it can  stop  after  all  eigenvalues  converged  with
                    error  roughly  proportional  to  eps*MAX(LAMBDA_MAX),
                    where LAMBDA_MAX is a maximum eigenvalue.
                    Zero  value  means  that  no  check  for  precision is
                    performed.
    MaxIts      -   maxits&gt;=0,  with non-zero value used  to  tell  solver
                    that it can stop after maxits  steps  (no  matter  how
                    precise current estimate is)

NOTE: passing  eps=0  and  maxits=0  results  in  automatic  selection  of
      moderate eps as stopping criteria (1.0E-6 in current implementation,
      but it may change without notice).

NOTE: very small values of eps are possible (say, 1.0E-12),  although  the
      larger problem you solve (N and/or K), the  harder  it  is  to  find
      precise eigenvectors because rounding errors tend to accumulate.

NOTE: passing non-zero eps results in  some performance  penalty,  roughly
      equal to 2N*(2K)^2 FLOPs per iteration. These additional computations
      are required in order to estimate current error in  eigenvalues  via
      Rayleigh-Ritz process.
      Most of this additional time is  spent  in  construction  of  ~2Kx2K
      symmetric  subproblem  whose  eigenvalues  are  checked  with  exact
      eigensolver.
      This additional time is negligible if you search for eigenvalues  of
      the large dense matrix, but may become noticeable on  highly  sparse
      EVD problems, where cost of matrix-matrix product is low.
      If you set eps to exactly zero,  Rayleigh-Ritz  phase  is completely
      turned off.

Finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a general (unsymmetric) matrix

  ! COMMERCIAL EDITION OF ALGLIB:
  !
  ! Commercial Edition of ALGLIB includes following important improvements
  ! of this function:
  ! * high-performance native backend with same C# interface (C# version)
  ! * hardware vendor (Intel) implementations of linear algebra primitives
  !   (C++ and C# versions, x86/x64 platform)
  !
  ! We recommend you to read 'Working with commercial version' section  of
  ! ALGLIB Reference Manual in order to find out how to  use  performance-
  ! related features provided by commercial edition of ALGLIB.

The algorithm finds eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a general matrix by
using the QR algorithm with multiple shifts. The algorithm can find
eigenvalues and both left and right eigenvectors.

The right eigenvector is a vector x such that A*x = w*x, and the left
eigenvector is a vector y such that y'*A = w*y' (here y' implies a complex
conjugate transposition of vector y).

Input parameters:
    A       -   matrix. Array whose indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..N-1].
    N       -   size of matrix A.
    VNeeded -   flag controlling whether eigenvectors are needed or not.
                If VNeeded is equal to:
                 * 0, eigenvectors are not returned;
                 * 1, right eigenvectors are returned;
                 * 2, left eigenvectors are returned;
                 * 3, both left and right eigenvectors are returned.

Output parameters:
    WR      -   real parts of eigenvalues.
                Array whose index ranges within [0..N-1].
    WR      -   imaginary parts of eigenvalues.
                Array whose index ranges within [0..N-1].
    VL, VR  -   arrays of left and right eigenvectors (if they are needed).
                If WI[i]=0, the respective eigenvalue is a real number,
                and it corresponds to the column number I of matrices VL/VR.
                If WI[i]&gt;0, we have a pair of complex conjugate numbers with
                positive and negative imaginary parts:
                    the first eigenvalue WR[i] + sqrt(-1)*WI[i];
                    the second eigenvalue WR[i+1] + sqrt(-1)*WI[i+1];
                    WI[i]&gt;0
                    WI[i+1] = -WI[i] &lt; 0
                In that case, the eigenvector  corresponding to the first
                eigenvalue is located in i and i+1 columns of matrices
                VL/VR (the column number i contains the real part, and the
                column number i+1 contains the imaginary part), and the vector
                corresponding to the second eigenvalue is a complex conjugate to
                the first vector.
                Arrays whose indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..N-1].

Result:
    True, if the algorithm has converged.
    False, if the algorithm has not converged.

Note 1:
    Some users may ask the following question: what if WI[N-1]&gt;0?
    WI[N] must contain an eigenvalue which is complex conjugate to the
    N-th eigenvalue, but the array has only size N?
    The answer is as follows: such a situation cannot occur because the
    algorithm finds a pairs of eigenvalues, therefore, if WI[i]&gt;0, I is
    strictly less than N-1.

Note 2:
    The algorithm performance depends on the value of the internal parameter
    NS of the InternalSchurDecomposition subroutine which defines the number
    of shifts in the QR algorithm (similarly to the block width in block-matrix
    algorithms of linear algebra). If you require maximum performance
    on your machine, it is recommended to adjust this parameter manually.


See also the InternalTREVC subroutine.

The algorithm is based on the LAPACK 3.0 library.

1-dimensional complex FFT.

Array size N may be arbitrary number (composite or prime).  Composite  N's
are handled with cache-oblivious variation of  a  Cooley-Tukey  algorithm.
Small prime-factors are transformed using hard coded  codelets (similar to
FFTW codelets, but without low-level  optimization),  large  prime-factors
are handled with Bluestein's algorithm.

Fastests transforms are for smooth N's (prime factors are 2, 3,  5  only),
most fast for powers of 2. When N have prime factors  larger  than  these,
but orders of magnitude smaller than N, computations will be about 4 times
slower than for nearby highly composite N's. When N itself is prime, speed
will be 6 times lower.

Algorithm has O(N*logN) complexity for any N (composite or prime).

    A   -   array[0..N-1] - complex function to be transformed

1-dimensional real inverse FFT.

Algorithm has O(N*logN) complexity for any N (composite or prime).

INPUT PARAMETERS
    F   -   array[0..floor(N/2)] - frequencies from forward real FFT
    N   -   problem size

OUTPUT PARAMETERS
    A   -   inverse DFT of a input array, array[0..N-1]

NOTE:
    F[] should satisfy symmetry property F[k] = conj(F[N-k]), so just  one
half of frequencies array is needed - elements from 0 to floor(N/2).  F[0]
is ALWAYS real. If N is even F[floor(N/2)] is real too. If N is odd,  then
F[floor(N/2)] has no special properties.

Relying on properties noted above, FFTR1DInv subroutine uses only elements
from 0th to floor(N/2)-th. It ignores imaginary part of F[0],  and in case
N is even it ignores imaginary part of F[floor(N/2)] too.

When you call this function using full arguments list - &quot;FFTR1DInv(F,N,A)&quot;
- you can pass either either frequencies array with N elements or  reduced
array with roughly N/2 elements - subroutine will  successfully  transform
both.

If you call this function using reduced arguments list -  &quot;FFTR1DInv(F,A)&quot;
- you must pass FULL array with N elements (although higher  N/2 are still
not used) because array size is used to automatically determine FFT length

NOTE 2: this algorithm uses BOTH previous points and  current  one,  i.e.
        new value of X[i] depends on BOTH previous point and X[i] itself.

NOTE 3: technical analytis users quite often work  with  EMA  coefficient
        expressed in DAYS instead of fractions. If you want to  calculate
        EMA(N), where N is a number of days, you can use alpha=2/(N+1).

Filters: linear regression moving averages.

This filter replaces array by results of LRMA(K) filter.

LRMA(K) is defined as filter which, for each data  point,  builds  linear
regression  model  using  K  prevous  points (point itself is included in
these K points) and calculates value of this linear model at the point in
question.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    X           -   array[N], array to process. It can be larger than N,
                    in this case only first N points are processed.
    N           -   points count, N&gt;=0
    K           -   K&gt;=1 (K can be larger than N ,  such  cases  will  be
                    correctly handled). Window width. K=1 corresponds  to
                    identity transformation (nothing changes).

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    X           -   array, whose first N elements were processed with SMA(K)

NOTE 1: this function uses efficient in-place  algorithm  which  does not
        allocate temporary arrays.

NOTE 2: this algorithm makes only one pass through array and uses running
        sum  to speed-up calculation of the averages. Additional measures
        are taken to ensure that running sum on a long sequence  of  zero
        elements will be correctly reset to zero even in the presence  of
        round-off error.

NOTE 3: this  is  unsymmetric version of the algorithm,  which  does  NOT
        averages points after the current one. Only X[i], X[i-1], ... are
        used when calculating new value of X[i]. We should also note that
        this algorithm uses BOTH previous points and  current  one,  i.e.
        new value of X[i] depends on BOTH previous point and X[i] itself.

Fitting minimum circumscribed, maximum inscribed or minimum  zone  circles
(or NX-dimensional spheres)  to  data  (a  set of points in NX-dimensional
space).

This  is  expert  function  which  allows  to  tweak  many  parameters  of
underlying nonlinear solver:
* stopping criteria for inner iterations
* number of outer iterations
* penalty coefficient used to handle  nonlinear  constraints  (we  convert
  unconstrained nonsmooth optimization problem ivolving max() and/or min()
  operations to quadratically constrained smooth one).

You may tweak all these parameters or only some  of  them,  leaving  other
ones at their default state - just specify zero  value,  and  solver  will
fill it with appropriate default one.

These comments also include some discussion of  approach  used  to  handle
such unusual fitting problem,  its  stability,  drawbacks  of  alternative
methods, and convergence properties.

INPUT PARAMETERS:

    ProblemType-used to encode problem type:

                * 1 for minimum circumscribed circle/sphere fitting (MC)
                * 2 for  maximum inscribed circle/sphere fitting (MI)
                * 3 for minimum zone circle fitting (difference between
                    Rhi and Rlo is minimized), denoted as MZ
    EpsX    -   stopping condition for NLC optimizer:
                * must be non-negative
                * use 0 to choose default value (1.0E-12 is used by default)
                * you may specify larger values, up to 1.0E-6, if you want
                  to   speed-up   solver;   NLC   solver  performs several
                  preconditioned  outer  iterations,   so   final   result
                  typically has precision much better than EpsX.
    AULIts  -   number of outer iterations performed by NLC optimizer:
                * must be non-negative
                * use 0 to choose default value (20 is used by default)
                * you may specify values smaller than 20 if you want to
                  speed up solver; 10 often results in good combination of
                  precision and speed; sometimes you may get good results
                  with just 6 outer iterations.
                Ignored for ProblemType=0.
    Penalty -   penalty coefficient for NLC optimizer:
                * must be non-negative
                * use 0 to choose default value (1.0E6 in current version)
                * it should be really large, 1.0E6...1.0E7 is a good value
                  to start from;
                * generally, default value is good enough
                Ignored for ProblemType=0.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    CX      -   central point for a sphere
    RLo     -   radius:

ALGLIB provides solution to several related circle fitting  problems:   MC
(minimum circumscribed), MI (maximum inscribed)   and   MZ  (minimum zone)
fitting, LS (least squares) fitting.

It  is  important  to  note  that  among these problems only MC and LS are
convex and have unique solution independently from starting point.

As  for MI,  it  may (or  may  not, depending on dataset properties)  have
multiple solutions, and it always  has  one degenerate solution C=infinity
which corresponds to infinitely large radius. Thus, there are no guarantees
that solution to  MI returned by this solver will be the best one (and  no
one can provide you with such guarantee because problem is  NP-hard).  The
only guarantee you have is that this solution is locally optimal, i.e.  it
can not be improved by infinitesimally small tweaks in the parameters.

It  is  also  possible  to &quot;run away&quot; to infinity when  started  from  bad
initial point located outside of point cloud (or when point cloud does not
span entire circumference/surface of the sphere).

Finally,  MZ (minimum zone circle) stands somewhere between MC  and  MI in
stability. It is somewhat regularized by &quot;circumscribed&quot; term of the merit
function; however, solutions to  MZ may be non-unique, and in some unlucky
cases it is also possible to &quot;run away to infinity&quot;.


NOTE: ON THE NONLINEARLY CONSTRAINED PROGRAMMING APPROACH

The problem formulation for MC  (minimum circumscribed   circle;  for  the
sake of simplicity we omit MZ and MI here) is:

        [     [         ]2 ]
    min [ max [ XY[i]-C ]  ]
     C  [  i  [         ]  ]

i.e. it is unconstrained nonsmooth optimization problem of finding  &quot;best&quot;
central point, with radius R being unambiguously  determined  from  C.  In
order to move away from non-smoothness we use following reformulation:

        [   ]                  [         ]2
    min [ R ] subject to R&gt;=0, [ XY[i]-C ]  &lt;= R^2
    C,R [   ]                  [         ]

i.e. it becomes smooth quadratically constrained optimization problem with
linear target function. Such problem statement is 100% equivalent  to  the
original nonsmooth one, but much easier  to  approach.  We solve  it  with
MinNLC solver provided by ALGLIB.


NOTE: ON INSTABILITY OF SEQUENTIAL LINEARIZATION APPROACH

ALGLIB  has  nonlinearly  constrained  solver which proved to be stable on
such problems. However, some authors proposed to linearize constraints  in
the vicinity of current approximation (Ci,Ri) and to get next  approximate
solution (Ci+1,Ri+1) as solution to linear programming problem. Obviously,
LP problems are easier than nonlinearly constrained ones.

Indeed,  such approach  to   MC/MI/MZ   resulted   in  ~10-20x increase in
performance (when compared with NLC solver). However, it turned  out  that
in some cases linearized model fails to predict correct direction for next
step and tells us that we converged to solution even when we are still 2-4
digits of precision away from it.

It is important that it is not failure of LP solver - it is failure of the
linear model;  even  when  solved  exactly,  it  fails  to  handle  subtle
nonlinearities which arise near the solution. We validated it by comparing
results returned by ALGLIB linear solver with that of MATLAB.

In our experiments with linearization:
* MC failed most often, at both realistic and synthetic datasets
* MI sometimes failed, but sometimes succeeded
* MZ often  succeeded; our guess is that presence of two independent  sets
  of constraints (one set for Rlo and another one for Rhi) and  two  terms
  in the target function (Rlo and Rhi) regularizes task,  so  when  linear
  model fails to handle nonlinearities from Rlo, it uses  Rhi  as  a  hint
  (and vice versa).

Because linearization approach failed to achieve stable results, we do not
include it in ALGLIB.

The domain of definition is 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1.  In this

This subroutine creates builder object used  to  generate IDW  model  from
irregularly sampled (scattered) dataset.  Multidimensional  scalar/vector-
-valued are supported.

Builder object is used to fit model to data as follows:
* builder object is created with idwbuildercreate() function
* dataset is added with idwbuildersetpoints() function
* one of the modern IDW algorithms is chosen with either:
  * idwbuildersetalgomstab()            - Multilayer STABilized algorithm (interpolation)
  Alternatively, one of the textbook algorithms can be chosen (not recommended):
  * idwbuildersetalgotextbookshepard()  - textbook Shepard algorithm
  * idwbuildersetalgotextbookmodshepard()-textbook modified Shepard algorithm
* finally, model construction is performed with idwfit() function.

This function sets IDW model  construction  algorithm  to  the  Multilayer
Stabilized IDW method (IDW-MSTAB), a  latest  incarnation  of  the inverse
distance weighting interpolation which fixes shortcomings of  the original
and modified Shepard's variants.

The distinctive features of IDW-MSTAB are:
1) exact interpolation  is  pursued  (as  opposed  to  fitting  and  noise
   suppression)
2) improved robustness when compared with that of other algorithms:
   * MSTAB shows almost no strange  fitting  artifacts  like  ripples  and
     sharp spikes (unlike N-dimensional splines and HRBFs)
   * MSTAB does not return function values far from the  interval  spanned
     by the dataset; say, if all your points have |f|&lt;=1, you  can be sure
     that model value won't deviate too much from [-1,+1]
3) good model construction time competing with that of HRBFs  and  bicubic
   splines
4) ability to work with any number of dimensions, starting from NX=1

The drawbacks of IDW-MSTAB (and all IDW algorithms in general) are:
1) dependence of the model evaluation time on the search radius
2) bad extrapolation properties, models built by this method  are  usually
   conservative in their predictions

Thus, IDW-MSTAB is  a  good  &quot;default&quot;  option  if  you  want  to  perform
scattered multidimensional interpolation. Although it has  its  drawbacks,
it is easy to use and robust, which makes it a good first step.


INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   builder object
    SRad    -   initial search radius, SRad&gt;0 is required. A model  value
                is obtained by &quot;smart&quot; averaging  of  the  dataset  points
                within search radius.

NOTE 1: IDW interpolation can  correctly  handle  ANY  dataset,  including
        datasets with non-distinct points. In case non-distinct points are
        found, an average value for this point will be calculated.

NOTE 2: the memory requirements for model storage are O(NPoints*NLayers).
        The model construction needs twice as much memory as model storage.

NOTE 3: by default 16 IDW layers are built which is enough for most cases.
        You can change this parameter with idwbuildersetnlayers()  method.
        Larger values may be necessary if you need to reproduce  extrafine
        details at distances smaller than SRad/65536.  Smaller value   may
        be necessary if you have to save memory and  computing  time,  and
        ready to sacrifice some model quality.


ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION

ALGLIB implementation of IDW is somewhat similar to the modified Shepard's
method (one with search radius R) but overcomes several of its  drawbacks,
namely:
1) a tendency to show stepwise behavior for uniform datasets
2) a tendency to show terrible interpolation properties for highly
   nonuniform datasets which often arise in geospatial tasks
  (function values are densely sampled across multiple separated
  &quot;tracks&quot;)

IDW-MSTAB method performs several passes over dataset and builds a sequence
of progressively refined IDW models  (layers),  which starts from one with
largest search radius SRad  and continues to smaller  search  radii  until
required number of  layers  is  built.  Highest  layers  reproduce  global
behavior of the target function at larger distances  whilst  lower  layers
reproduce fine details at smaller distances.

Each layer is an IDW model built with following modifications:
* weights go to zero when distance approach to the current search radius
* an additional regularizing term is added to the distance: w=1/(d^2+lambda)
* an additional fictional term with unit weight and zero function value is
  added in order to promote continuity  properties  at  the  isolated  and
  boundary points

By default, 16 layers is built, which is enough for most  cases.  You  can
change this parameter with idwbuildersetnlayers() method.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS
    Buf         -   external buffer.


IMPORTANT: buffer object should be used only with  IDW model object  which
           was used to initialize buffer. Any attempt to use buffer   with
           different object is dangerous - you may  get  memory  violation

           of the IDW structure.

IMPORTANT: you  should  call  this function only for model which was built
           with model builder (or unserialized from file). Sizes  of  some
           internal structures are determined only after model  is  built,
           so buffer object created before model construction  stage  will
           be useless (and any attempt to use it will result in exception).

This function serializes data structure to string.

Important properties of s_out:
* it contains alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, minus signs
* these symbols are grouped into words, which are separated by spaces
  and Windows-style (CR+LF) newlines
* although  serializer  uses  spaces and CR+LF as separators, you can 
  replace any separator character by arbitrary combination of spaces,
  tabs, Windows or Unix newlines. It allows flexible reformatting  of
  the  string  in  case you want to include it into text or XML file. 
  But you should not insert separators into the middle of the &quot;words&quot;
  nor you should change case of letters.
* s_out can be freely moved between 32-bit and 64-bit systems, little
  and big endian machines, and so on. You can serialize structure  on
  32-bit machine and unserialize it on 64-bit one (or vice versa), or
  serialize  it  on  SPARC  and  unserialize  on  x86.  You  can also 
  serialize  it  in  C++ version of ALGLIB and unserialize in C# one,

Jacobian Elliptic Functions

Evaluates the Jacobian elliptic functions sn(u|m), cn(u|m),
and dn(u|m) of parameter m between 0 and 1, and real
argument u.

These functions are periodic, with quarter-period on the
real axis equal to the complete elliptic integral
ellpk(1.0-m).

Relation to incomplete elliptic integral:
If u = ellik(phi,m), then sn(u|m) = sin(phi),
and cn(u|m) = cos(phi).  Phi is called the amplitude of u.

Computation is by means of the arithmetic-geometric mean
algorithm, except when m is within 1e-9 of 0 or 1.  In the
latter case with m close to 1, the approximation applies
only for phi &lt; pi/2.

ACCURACY:

Tested at random points with u between 0 and 10, m between
0 and 1.

           Absolute error (* = relative error):
arithmetic   function   # trials      peak         rms
   IEEE      phi         10000       9.2e-16*    1.4e-16*
   IEEE      sn          50000       4.1e-15     4.6e-16
   IEEE      cn          40000       3.6e-15     4.4e-16
   IEEE      dn          10000       1.3e-12     1.8e-14

 Peak error observed in consistency check using addition
theorem for sn(u+v) was 4e-16 (absolute).  Also tested by
the above relation to the incomplete elliptic integral.
Accuracy deteriorates when u is large.

Changing search settings of KNN model.

K and EPS parameters of KNN  (AKNN)  search  are  specified  during  model
construction. However, plain KNN algorithm with Euclidean distance  allows
you to change them at any moment.

NOTE: future versions of KNN model may support advanced versions  of  KNN,
      such as NCA or LMNN. It is possible that such algorithms won't allow
      you to change search settings on the fly. If you call this  function
      for an algorithm which does not support on-the-fly changes, it  will
      throw an exception.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    Model   -   KNN model
    K       -   K&gt;=1, neighbors count
    EPS     -   accuracy of the EPS-approximate NN search. Set to 0.0,  if
                you want to perform &quot;classic&quot; KNN search.  Specify  larger
                values  if  you  need  to  speed-up  high-dimensional  KNN
                queries.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    nothing on success, exception on failure

Important properties of s_out:
* it contains alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, minus signs

* although  serializer  uses  spaces and CR+LF as separators, you can 
  replace any separator character by arbitrary combination of spaces,
  tabs, Windows or Unix newlines. It allows flexible reformatting  of
  the  string  in  case you want to include it into text or XML file. 
  But you should not insert separators into the middle of the &quot;words&quot;
  nor you should change case of letters.
* s_out can be freely moved between 32-bit and 64-bit systems, little

  32-bit machine and unserialize it on 64-bit one (or vice versa), or

Multiclass Fisher LDA

Subroutine finds coefficients of linear combination which optimally separates
training set on classes.

COMMERCIAL EDITION OF ALGLIB:

  ! Commercial version of ALGLIB includes two important  improvements   of
  ! this function, which can be used from C++ and C#:
  ! * Intel MKL support (lightweight Intel MKL is shipped with ALGLIB)
  ! * multithreading support
  !
  ! Intel MKL gives approximately constant  (with  respect  to  number  of
  ! worker threads) acceleration factor which depends on CPU  being  used,
  ! problem  size  and  &quot;baseline&quot;  ALGLIB  edition  which  is  used   for
  ! comparison. Best results are achieved  for  high-dimensional  problems
  ! (NVars is at least 256).
  !
  ! Multithreading is used to  accelerate  initial  phase  of  LDA,  which
  ! includes calculation of products of large matrices.  Again,  for  best
  ! efficiency problem must be high-dimensional.
  !
  ! Generally, commercial ALGLIB is several times faster than  open-source
  ! generic C edition, and many times faster than open-source C# edition.
  !
  ! We recommend you to read 'Working with commercial version' section  of
  ! ALGLIB Reference Manual in order to find out how to  use  performance-
  ! related features provided by commercial edition of ALGLIB.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    XY          -   training set, array[0..NPoints-1,0..NVars].
                    First NVars columns store values of independent
                    variables, next column stores number of class (from 0
                    to NClasses-1) which dataset element belongs to. Fractional
                    values are rounded to nearest integer.
    NPoints     -   training set size, NPoints&gt;=0
    NVars       -   number of independent variables, NVars&gt;=1
    NClasses    -   number of classes, NClasses&gt;=2


OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    Info        -   return code:
                    * -4, if internal EVD subroutine hasn't converged
                    * -2, if there is a point with class number
                          outside of [0..NClasses-1].
                    * -1, if incorrect parameters was passed (NPoints&lt;0,
                          NVars&lt;1, NClasses&lt;2)
                    *  1, if task has been solved
                    *  2, if there was a multicollinearity in training set,
                          but task has been solved.
    W           -   linear combination coefficients, array[0..NVars-1]

Procedure for solution of A*x=b with sparse A.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   algorithm state
    A       -   sparse matrix in the CRS format (you MUST contvert  it  to

RESULT:
    This function returns no result.
    You can get solution by calling LinCGResults()

NOTE: this function uses lightweight preconditioning -  multiplication  by
      inverse of diag(A). If you want, you can turn preconditioning off by
      calling LinCGSetPrecUnit(). However, preconditioning cost is low and
      preconditioner  is  very  important  for  solution  of  badly scaled
      problems.

This function initializes linear LSQR Solver. This solver is used to solve
non-symmetric (and, possibly, non-square) problems. Least squares solution
is returned for non-compatible systems.

USAGE:
1. User initializes algorithm state with LinLSQRCreate() call
2. User tunes solver parameters with  LinLSQRSetCond() and other functions
3. User  calls  LinLSQRSolveSparse()  function which takes algorithm state
   and SparseMatrix object.
4. User calls LinLSQRResults() to get solution
5. Optionally, user may call LinLSQRSolveSparse() again to  solve  another
   problem  with different matrix and/or right part without reinitializing
   LinLSQRState structure.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    M       -   number of rows in A
    N       -   number of variables, N&gt;0

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

NOTE: see also linlsqrcreatebuf()  for  version  which  reuses  previously
      allocated place as much as possible.

SETTING CONSTRAINTS - DANGERS AND OPPORTUNITIES:

Setting constraints can lead  to undesired  results,  like ill-conditioned
behavior, or inconsistency being detected. From the other side,  it allows
us to improve quality of the fit. Here we summarize  our  experience  with
constrained barycentric interpolants:
* excessive  constraints  can  be  inconsistent.   Floater-Hormann   basis
  functions aren't as flexible as splines (although they are very smooth).
* the more evenly constraints are spread across [min(x),max(x)],  the more
  chances that they will be consistent
* the  greater  is  M (given  fixed  constraints),  the  more chances that
  constraints will be consistent
* in the general case, consistency of constraints IS NOT GUARANTEED.
* in the several special cases, however, we CAN guarantee consistency.
* one of this cases is constraints on the function  VALUES at the interval
  boundaries. Note that consustency of the  constraints  on  the  function
  DERIVATIVES is NOT guaranteed (you can use in such cases  cubic  splines
  which are more flexible).
* another  special  case  is ONE constraint on the function value (OR, but
  not AND, derivative) anywhere in the interval

Our final recommendation is to use constraints  WHEN  AND  ONLY  WHEN  you
can't solve your task without them. Anything beyond  special  cases  given
above is not guaranteed and may result in inconsistency.

This function fits four-parameter logistic (4PL) model  to  data  provided
by user. 4PL model has following form:

    F(x|A,B,C,D) = D+(A-D)/(1+Power(x/C,B))

Here:
    * A, D - unconstrained (see LogisticFit4EC() for constrained 4PL)
    * B&gt;=0
    * C&gt;0

IMPORTANT: output of this function is constrained in  such  way that  B&gt;0.
           Because 4PL model is symmetric with respect to B, there  is  no
           need to explore  B&lt;0.  Constraining  B  makes  algorithm easier
           to stabilize and debug.
           Users  who  for  some  reason  prefer to work with negative B's
           should transform output themselves (swap A and D, replace B  by
           -B).

4PL fitting is implemented as follows:
* we perform small number of restarts from random locations which helps to
  solve problem of bad local extrema. Locations are only partially  random
  - we use input data to determine good  initial  guess,  but  we  include
  controlled amount of randomness.
* we perform Levenberg-Marquardt fitting with very  tight  constraints  on
  parameters B and C - it allows us to find good  initial  guess  for  the
  second stage without risk of running into &quot;flat spot&quot;.
* second  Levenberg-Marquardt  round  is   performed   without   excessive
  constraints. Results from the previous round are used as initial guess.
* after fitting is done, we compare results with best values found so far,
  rewrite &quot;best solution&quot; if needed, and move to next random location.

Overall algorithm is very stable and is not prone to  bad  local  extrema.
Furthermore, it automatically scales when input data have  very  large  or
very small range.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    X       -   array[N], stores X-values.
                MUST include only non-negative numbers  (but  may  include
                zero values). Can be unsorted.
    Y       -   array[N], values to fit.
    N       -   number of points. If N is less than  length  of  X/Y, only
                leading N elements are used.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    A, B, C, D- parameters of 4PL model
    Rep     -   fitting report. This structure has many fields,  but  ONLY
                ONES LISTED BELOW ARE SET:
                * Rep.IterationsCount - number of iterations performed
                * Rep.RMSError - root-mean-square error
                * Rep.AvgError - average absolute error
                * Rep.AvgRelError - average relative error (calculated for
                  non-zero Y-values)
                * Rep.MaxError - maximum absolute error
                * Rep.R2 - coefficient of determination,  R-squared.  This
                  coefficient   is  calculated  as  R2=1-RSS/TSS  (in case
                  of nonlinear  regression  there  are  multiple  ways  to
                  define R2, each of them giving different results).

NOTE: for stability reasons the B parameter is restricted by [1/1000,1000]
      range. It prevents  algorithm from making trial steps  deep into the
      area of bad parameters.

NOTE: after  you  obtained  coefficients,  you  can  evaluate  model  with
      LogisticCalc4() function.

NOTE: if you need better control over fitting process than provided by this
      function, you may use LogisticFit45X().

NOTE: step is automatically scaled according to scale of parameters  being
      fitted before we compare its length with EpsX. Thus,  this  function
      can be used to fit data with very small or very large values without
      changing EpsX.

    * B&gt;=0 for 4PL, unconstrained for 5PL
    * C&gt;0
    * G&gt;0 (if present)

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    X       -   array[N], stores X-values.
                MUST include only non-negative numbers  (but  may  include
                zero values). Can be unsorted.
    Y       -   array[N], values to fit.
    N       -   number of points. If N is less than  length  of  X/Y, only
                leading N elements are used.
    CnstrLeft-  optional equality constraint for model value at the   left
                boundary (at X=0). Specify NAN (Not-a-Number)  if  you  do
                not need constraint on the model value at X=0 (in C++  you
                can pass alglib::fp_nan as parameter, in  C#  it  will  be
                Double.NaN).
                See  below,  section  &quot;EQUALITY  CONSTRAINTS&quot;   for   more
                information about constraints.
    CnstrRight- optional equality constraint for model value at X=infinity.
                Specify NAN (Not-a-Number) if you do not  need  constraint
                on the model value (in C++  you can pass alglib::fp_nan as
                parameter, in  C# it will  be Double.NaN).
                See  below,  section  &quot;EQUALITY  CONSTRAINTS&quot;   for   more
                information about constraints.
    Is4PL   -   whether 4PL or 5PL models are fitted
    LambdaV -   regularization coefficient, LambdaV&gt;=0.
                Set it to zero unless you know what you are doing.
    EpsX    -   stopping condition (step size), EpsX&gt;=0.
                Zero value means that small step is automatically chosen.
                See notes below for more information.
    RsCnt   -   number of repeated restarts from  random  points.  4PL/5PL
                models are prone to problem of bad local extrema. Utilizing
                multiple random restarts allows  us  to  improve algorithm
                convergence.
                RsCnt&gt;=0.
                Zero value means that function automatically choose  small
                amount of restarts (recommended).

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    A, B, C, D- parameters of 4PL model
    G       -   parameter of 5PL model; for Is4PL=True, G=1 is returned.
    Rep     -   fitting report. This structure has many fields,  but  ONLY
                ONES LISTED BELOW ARE SET:
                * Rep.IterationsCount - number of iterations performed
                * Rep.RMSError - root-mean-square error
                * Rep.AvgError - average absolute error
                * Rep.AvgRelError - average relative error (calculated for
                  non-zero Y-values)
                * Rep.MaxError - maximum absolute error
                * Rep.R2 - coefficient of determination,  R-squared.  This
                  coefficient   is  calculated  as  R2=1-RSS/TSS  (in case
                  of nonlinear  regression  there  are  multiple  ways  to
                  define R2, each of them giving different results).

NOTE: for better stability B  parameter is restricted by [+-1/1000,+-1000]
      range, and G is restricted by [1/10,10] range. It prevents algorithm
      from making trial steps deep into the area of bad parameters.

NOTE: after  you  obtained  coefficients,  you  can  evaluate  model  with
      LogisticCalc5() function.

NOTE: step is automatically scaled according to scale of parameters  being
      fitted before we compare its length with EpsX. Thus,  this  function
      can be used to fit data with very small or very large values without
      changing EpsX.

EQUALITY CONSTRAINTS ON PARAMETERS

4PL/5PL solver supports equality constraints on model values at  the  left
boundary (X=0) and right  boundary  (X=infinity).  These  constraints  are
completely optional and you can specify both of them, only  one  -  or  no
constraints at all.

Parameter  CnstrLeft  contains  left  constraint (or NAN for unconstrained
fitting), and CnstrRight contains right  one.  For  4PL,  left  constraint
ALWAYS corresponds to parameter A, and right one is ALWAYS  constraint  on
D. That's because 4PL model is normalized in such way that B&gt;=0.

For 5PL model things are different. Unlike  4PL  one,  5PL  model  is  NOT
symmetric with respect to  change  in  sign  of  B. Thus, negative B's are
possible, and left constraint may constrain parameter A (for positive B's)
- or parameter D (for negative B's). Similarly changes  meaning  of  right
constraint.

You do not have to decide what parameter to  constrain  -  algorithm  will
automatically determine correct parameters as fitting progresses. However,
question highlighted above is important when you interpret fitting results.

This function fits four-parameter logistic (4PL) model  to  data  provided
by user, with optional constraints on parameters A and D.  4PL  model  has
following form:

    F(x|A,B,C,D) = D+(A-D)/(1+Power(x/C,B))

Here:
    * A, D - with optional equality constraints
    * B&gt;=0
    * C&gt;0

IMPORTANT: output of this function is constrained in  such  way that  B&gt;0.
           Because 4PL model is symmetric with respect to B, there  is  no
           need to explore  B&lt;0.  Constraining  B  makes  algorithm easier
           to stabilize and debug.
           Users  who  for  some  reason  prefer to work with negative B's
           should transform output themselves (swap A and D, replace B  by
           -B).

4PL fitting is implemented as follows:
* we perform small number of restarts from random locations which helps to
  solve problem of bad local extrema. Locations are only partially  random
  - we use input data to determine good  initial  guess,  but  we  include
  controlled amount of randomness.
* we perform Levenberg-Marquardt fitting with very  tight  constraints  on
  parameters B and C - it allows us to find good  initial  guess  for  the
  second stage without risk of running into &quot;flat spot&quot;.
* second  Levenberg-Marquardt  round  is   performed   without   excessive
  constraints. Results from the previous round are used as initial guess.
* after fitting is done, we compare results with best values found so far,
  rewrite &quot;best solution&quot; if needed, and move to next random location.

Overall algorithm is very stable and is not prone to  bad  local  extrema.
Furthermore, it automatically scales when input data have  very  large  or
very small range.

                  coefficient   is  calculated  as  R2=1-RSS/TSS  (in case
                  of nonlinear  regression  there  are  multiple  ways  to
                  define R2, each of them giving different results).

NOTE: for better stability B  parameter is restricted by [+-1/1000,+-1000]
      range, and G is restricted by [1/10,10] range. It prevents algorithm
      from making trial steps deep into the area of bad parameters.

NOTE: after  you  obtained  coefficients,  you  can  evaluate  model  with
      LogisticCalc5() function.

NOTE: if you need better control over fitting process than provided by this
      function, you may use LogisticFit45X().

NOTE: step is automatically scaled according to scale of parameters  being
      fitted before we compare its length with EpsX. Thus,  this  function
      can be used to fit data with very small or very large values without
      changing EpsX.

EQUALITY CONSTRAINTS ON PARAMETERS

5PL solver supports equality constraints on model  values  at   the   left
boundary (X=0) and right  boundary  (X=infinity).  These  constraints  are
completely optional and you can specify both of them, only  one  -  or  no
constraints at all.

Parameter  CnstrLeft  contains  left  constraint (or NAN for unconstrained
fitting), and CnstrRight contains right  one.

Unlike 4PL one, 5PL model is NOT symmetric with respect to  change in sign
of B. Thus, negative B's are possible, and left constraint  may  constrain
parameter A (for positive B's)  -  or  parameter  D  (for  negative  B's).
Similarly changes meaning of right constraint.

You do not have to decide what parameter to  constrain  -  algorithm  will
automatically determine correct parameters as fitting progresses. However,
question highlighted above is important when you interpret fitting results.

NOTES:

1. this algorithm is somewhat unusual because it works with  parameterized
   function f(C,X), where X is a function argument (we  have  many  points
   which are characterized by different  argument  values),  and  C  is  a
   parameter to fit.

   For example, if we want to do linear fit by f(c0,c1,x) = c0*x+c1,  then
   x will be argument, and {c0,c1} will be parameters.

   It is important to understand that this algorithm finds minimum in  the
   space of function PARAMETERS (not arguments), so it  needs  derivatives
   of f() with respect to C, not X.

   In the example above it will need f=c0*x+c1 and {df/dc0,df/dc1} = {x,1}
   instead of {df/dx} = {c0}.

2. Callback functions accept C as the first parameter, and X as the second

3. If  state  was  created  with  LSFitCreateFG(),  algorithm  needs  just
   function   and   its   gradient,   but   if   state   was  created with
   LSFitCreateFGH(), algorithm will need function, gradient and Hessian.

   According  to  the  said  above,  there  ase  several  versions of this
   function, which accept different sets of callbacks.

   This flexibility opens way to subtle errors - you may create state with
   LSFitCreateFGH() (optimization using Hessian), but call function  which
   does not accept Hessian. So when algorithm will request Hessian,  there
   will be no callback to call. In this case exception will be thrown.

   Be careful to avoid such errors because there is no way to find them at
   compile time - you can see them at runtime only.

Linear least squares fitting.

QR decomposition is used to reduce task to MxM, then triangular solver  or

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    Y       -   array[0..N-1] Function values in  N  points.
    FMatrix -   a table of basis functions values, array[0..N-1, 0..M-1].
                FMatrix[I, J] - value of J-th basis function in I-th point.
    N       -   number of points used. N&gt;=1.
    M       -   number of basis functions, M&gt;=1.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    Info    -   error code:
                * -4    internal SVD decomposition subroutine failed (very
                        rare and for degenerate systems only)
                *  1    task is solved
    C       -   decomposition coefficients, array[0..M-1]
    Rep     -   fitting report. Following fields are set:
                * Rep.TaskRCond     reciprocal of condition number
                * R2                non-adjusted coefficient of determination
                                    (non-weighted)
                * RMSError          rms error on the (X,Y).
                * AvgError          average error on the (X,Y).
                * AvgRelError       average relative error on the non-zero Y
                * MaxError          maximum error
                                    NON-WEIGHTED ERRORS ARE CALCULATED

ERRORS IN PARAMETERS

This  solver  also  calculates different kinds of errors in parameters and
fills corresponding fields of report:
* Rep.CovPar        covariance matrix for parameters, array[K,K].
* Rep.ErrPar        errors in parameters, array[K],
                    errpar = sqrt(diag(CovPar))
* Rep.ErrCurve      vector of fit errors - standard deviations of empirical
                    best-fit curve from &quot;ideal&quot; best-fit curve built  with
                    infinite number of samples, array[N].
                    errcurve = sqrt(diag(F*CovPar*F')),
                    where F is functions matrix.
* Rep.Noise         vector of per-point estimates of noise, array[N]

NOTE:       noise in the data is estimated as follows:
            * for fitting without user-supplied  weights  all  points  are
              assumed to have same level of noise, which is estimated from
              the data
            * for fitting with user-supplied weights we assume that  noise
              level in I-th point is inversely proportional to Ith weight.
              Coefficient of proportionality is estimated from the data.

NOTE:       we apply small amount of regularization when we invert squared
            Jacobian and calculate covariance matrix. It  guarantees  that
            algorithm won't divide by zero  during  inversion,  but  skews
            error estimates a bit (fractional error is about 10^-9).

            However, we believe that this difference is insignificant  for
            all practical purposes except for the situation when you  want
            to compare ALGLIB results with &quot;reference&quot;  implementation  up
            to the last significant digit.

NOTE:       covariance matrix is estimated using  correction  for  degrees
            of freedom (covariances are divided by N-M instead of dividing
            by N).

Weighted constained linear least squares fitting.

This  is  variation  of LSFitLinearW(), which searchs for min|A*x=b| given
that  K  additional  constaints  C*x=bc are satisfied. It reduces original
task to modified one: min|B*y-d| WITHOUT constraints,  then LSFitLinearW()
is called.

IMPORTANT: if you want to perform  polynomial  fitting,  it  may  be  more
           convenient to use PolynomialFit() function. This function gives
           best  results  on  polynomial  problems  and  solves  numerical
           stability  issues  which  arise  when   you   fit   high-degree
           polynomials to your data.

  ! COMMERCIAL EDITION OF ALGLIB:

  ! Commercial Edition of ALGLIB includes following important improvements
  ! of this function:
  ! * high-performance native backend with same C# interface (C# version)
  ! * multithreading support (C++ and C# versions)
  ! * hardware vendor (Intel) implementations of linear algebra primitives
  !   (C++ and C# versions, x86/x64 platform)
  !
  ! We recommend you to read 'Working with commercial version' section  of
  ! ALGLIB Reference Manual in order to find out how to  use  performance-
  ! related features provided by commercial edition of ALGLIB.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    Y       -   array[0..N-1] Function values in  N  points.
    W       -   array[0..N-1]  Weights  corresponding to function  values.
                Each summand in square  sum  of  approximation  deviations
                from  given  values  is  multiplied  by  the   square   of
                corresponding weight.
    FMatrix -   a table of basis functions values, array[0..N-1, 0..M-1].
                FMatrix[I,J] - value of J-th basis function in I-th point.
    CMatrix -   a table of constaints, array[0..K-1,0..M].
                I-th row of CMatrix corresponds to I-th linear constraint:
                CMatrix[I,0]*C[0] + ... + CMatrix[I,M-1]*C[M-1] = CMatrix[I,M]
    N       -   number of points used. N&gt;=1.
    M       -   number of basis functions, M&gt;=1.
    K       -   number of constraints, 0 &lt;= K &lt; M
                K=0 corresponds to absence of constraints.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    Info    -   error code:
                * -4    internal SVD decomposition subroutine failed (very
                        rare and for degenerate systems only)
                * -3    either   too   many  constraints  (M   or   more),
                        degenerate  constraints   (some   constraints  are
                        repetead twice) or inconsistent  constraints  were
                        specified.
                *  1    task is solved
    C       -   decomposition coefficients, array[0..M-1]
    Rep     -   fitting report. Following fields are set:
                * R2                non-adjusted coefficient of determination
                                    (non-weighted)
                * RMSError          rms error on the (X,Y).
                * AvgError          average error on the (X,Y).
                * AvgRelError       average relative error on the non-zero Y
                * MaxError          maximum error
                                    NON-WEIGHTED ERRORS ARE CALCULATED

IMPORTANT:
    this subroitine doesn't calculate task's condition number for K&lt;&gt;0.

ERRORS IN PARAMETERS

This  solver  also  calculates different kinds of errors in parameters and
fills corresponding fields of report:
* Rep.CovPar        covariance matrix for parameters, array[K,K].
* Rep.ErrPar        errors in parameters, array[K],
                    errpar = sqrt(diag(CovPar))
* Rep.ErrCurve      vector of fit errors - standard deviations of empirical
                    best-fit curve from &quot;ideal&quot; best-fit curve built  with
                    infinite number of samples, array[N].
                    errcurve = sqrt(diag(F*CovPar*F')),
                    where F is functions matrix.
* Rep.Noise         vector of per-point estimates of noise, array[N]

IMPORTANT:  errors  in  parameters  are  calculated  without  taking  into
            account boundary/linear constraints! Presence  of  constraints
            changes distribution of errors, but there is no  easy  way  to
            account for constraints when you calculate covariance matrix.

NOTE:       noise in the data is estimated as follows:
            * for fitting without user-supplied  weights  all  points  are
              assumed to have same level of noise, which is estimated from
              the data
            * for fitting with user-supplied weights we assume that  noise
              level in I-th point is inversely proportional to Ith weight.
              Coefficient of proportionality is estimated from the data.

NOTE:       we apply small amount of regularization when we invert squared
            Jacobian and calculate covariance matrix. It  guarantees  that
            algorithm won't divide by zero  during  inversion,  but  skews
            error estimates a bit (fractional error is about 10^-9).

            However, we believe that this difference is insignificant  for
            all practical purposes except for the situation when you  want
            to compare ALGLIB results with &quot;reference&quot;  implementation  up
            to the last significant digit.

NOTE:       covariance matrix is estimated using  correction  for  degrees
            of freedom (covariances are divided by N-M instead of dividing
            by N).

This  subroutine  turns  on  verification  of  the  user-supplied analytic
gradient:
* user calls this subroutine before fitting begins
* LSFitFit() is called
* prior to actual fitting, for  each  point  in  data  set  X_i  and  each
  component  of  parameters  being  fited C_j algorithm performs following
  steps:
  * two trial steps are made to C_j-TestStep*S[j] and C_j+TestStep*S[j],
    where C_j is j-th parameter and S[j] is a scale of j-th parameter
  * if needed, steps are bounded with respect to constraints on C[]
  * F(X_i|C) is evaluated at these trial points
  * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
  * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
    points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
    point
  * in case difference between prediction and actual value is higher  than
    some predetermined threshold, algorithm stops with completion code -7;
    Rep.VarIdx is set to index of the parameter with incorrect derivative.
* after verification is over, algorithm proceeds to the actual optimization.

NOTE 1: verification needs N*K (points count * parameters count)  gradient
        evaluations. It is very costly and you should use it only for  low
        dimensional  problems,  when  you  want  to  be  sure  that you've
        correctly calculated analytic derivatives. You should not  use  it
        in the production code  (unless  you  want  to  check  derivatives
        provided by some third party).

NOTE 2: you  should  carefully  choose  TestStep. Value which is too large
        (so large that function behaviour is significantly non-cubic) will
        lead to false alarms. You may use  different  step  for  different
        parameters by means of setting scale with LSFitSetScale().

NOTE 3: this function may lead to false positives. In case it reports that
        I-th  derivative was calculated incorrectly, you may decrease test
        step  and  try  one  more  time  - maybe your function changes too
        sharply  and  your  step  is  too  large for such rapidly chanding
        function.

NOTE 4: this function works only for optimizers created with LSFitCreateWFG()
        or LSFitCreateFG() constructors.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State       -   structure used to store algorithm state
    TestStep    -   verification step:
                    * TestStep=0 turns verification off
                    * TestStep&gt;0 activates verification

This function sets linear constraints for underlying optimizer

Linear constraints are inactive by default (after initial creation).
They are preserved until explicitly turned off with another SetLC() call.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure stores algorithm state
    C       -   linear constraints, array[K,N+1].
                Each row of C represents one constraint, either equality
                or inequality (see below):
                * first N elements correspond to coefficients,
                * last element corresponds to the right part.
                All elements of C (including right part) must be finite.
    CT      -   type of constraints, array[K]:
                * if CT[i]&gt;0, then I-th constraint is C[i,*]*x &gt;= C[i,n+1]
                * if CT[i]=0, then I-th constraint is C[i,*]*x  = C[i,n+1]
                * if CT[i]&lt;0, then I-th constraint is C[i,*]*x &lt;= C[i,n+1]
    K       -   number of equality/inequality constraints, K&gt;=0:
                * if given, only leading K elements of C/CT are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from sizes of C/CT

IMPORTANT: if you have linear constraints, it is strongly  recommended  to
           set scale of variables with lsfitsetscale(). QP solver which is
           used to calculate linearly constrained steps heavily relies  on
           good scaling of input problems.

NOTE: linear  (non-box)  constraints  are  satisfied only approximately  -
      there  always  exists some violation due  to  numerical  errors  and
      algorithmic limitations.

NOTE: general linear constraints  add  significant  overhead  to  solution
      process. Although solver performs roughly same amount of  iterations
      (when compared  with  similar  box-only  constrained  problem), each
      iteration   now    involves  solution  of  linearly  constrained  QP
      subproblem, which requires ~3-5 times more Cholesky  decompositions.
      Thus, if you can reformulate your problem in such way  this  it  has
      only box constraints, it may be beneficial to do so.

This function sets scaling coefficients for underlying optimizer.

ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
a) &quot;how large&quot; the variable is
b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

Generally, scale is NOT considered to be a form of preconditioner.  But LM
optimizer is unique in that it uses scaling matrix both  in  the  stopping
condition tests and as Marquardt damping factor.

Proper scaling is very important for the algorithm performance. It is less
important for the quality of results, but still has some influence (it  is
easier  to  converge  when  variables  are  properly  scaled, so premature
stopping is possible when very badly scalled variables are  combined  with
relaxed stopping conditions).

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure stores algorithm state
    S       -   array[N], non-zero scaling coefficients
                S[i] may be negative, sign doesn't matter.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state
    StpMax  -   maximum step length, &gt;=0. Set StpMax to 0.0,  if you don't
                want to limit step length.

Use this subroutine when you optimize target function which contains exp()
or  other  fast  growing  functions,  and optimization algorithm makes too
large  steps  which  leads  to overflow. This function allows us to reject
steps  that  are  too  large  (and  therefore  expose  us  to the possible
overflow) without actually calculating function value at the x+stp*d.

NOTE: non-zero StpMax leads to moderate  performance  degradation  because
intermediate  step  of  preconditioned L-BFGS optimization is incompatible
with limits on step size.

SETTING CONSTRAINTS - DANGERS AND OPPORTUNITIES:

Setting constraints can lead  to undesired  results,  like ill-conditioned
behavior, or inconsistency being detected. From the other side,  it allows
us to improve quality of the fit. Here we summarize  our  experience  with
constrained regression splines:
* even simple constraints can be inconsistent, see  Wikipedia  article  on
  this subject: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkhoff_interpolation
* the  greater  is  M (given  fixed  constraints),  the  more chances that
  constraints will be consistent
* in the general case, consistency of constraints is NOT GUARANTEED.
* in the one special cases, however, we can  guarantee  consistency.  This
  case  is:  M&gt;1  and constraints on the function values (NOT DERIVATIVES)

Our final recommendation is to use constraints  WHEN  AND  ONLY  when  you
can't solve your task without them. Anything beyond  special  cases  given
above is not guaranteed and may result in inconsistency.

Weighted fitting by cubic  spline,  with constraints on function values or
derivatives.

Equidistant grid with M-2 nodes on [min(x,xc),max(x,xc)] is  used to build
basis functions. Basis functions are cubic splines with continuous  second
derivatives  and  non-fixed first  derivatives  at  interval  ends.  Small
regularizing term is used  when  solving  constrained  tasks  (to  improve
stability).

Task is linear, so linear least squares solver is used. Complexity of this
computational scheme is O(N*M^2), mostly dominated by least squares solver

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    X   -   points, array[0..N-1].
    Y   -   function values, array[0..N-1].
    W   -   weights, array[0..N-1]
            Each summand in square  sum  of  approximation deviations from
            given  values  is  multiplied  by  the square of corresponding
            weight. Fill it by 1's if you don't  want  to  solve  weighted
            task.
    N   -   number of points (optional):
            * N&gt;0
            * if given, only first N elements of X/Y/W are processed
            * if not given, automatically determined from X/Y/W sizes
    XC  -   points where spline values/derivatives are constrained,
            array[0..K-1].
    YC  -   values of constraints, array[0..K-1]
    DC  -   array[0..K-1], types of constraints:
            * DC[i]=0   means that S(XC[i])=YC[i]
            * DC[i]=1   means that S'(XC[i])=YC[i]
            SEE BELOW FOR IMPORTANT INFORMATION ON CONSTRAINTS
    K   -   number of constraints (optional):
            * 0&lt;=K&lt;M.
            * K=0 means no constraints (XC/YC/DC are not used)
            * if given, only first K elements of XC/YC/DC are used
            * if not given, automatically determined from XC/YC/DC
    M   -   number of basis functions ( = number_of_nodes+2), M&gt;=4.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    Info-   same format as in LSFitLinearWC() subroutine.
            * Info&gt;0    task is solved
            * Info&lt;=0   an error occured:
                        -4 means inconvergence of internal SVD
                        -3 means inconsistent constraints
    S   -   spline interpolant.
    Rep -   report, same format as in LSFitLinearWC() subroutine.
            Following fields are set:
            * RMSError      rms error on the (X,Y).
            * AvgError      average error on the (X,Y).
            * AvgRelError   average relative error on the non-zero Y
            * MaxError      maximum error
                            NON-WEIGHTED ERRORS ARE CALCULATED

IMPORTANT:
    this subroitine doesn't calculate task's condition number for K&lt;&gt;0.


ORDER OF POINTS

Subroutine automatically sorts points, so caller may pass unsorted array.

SETTING CONSTRAINTS - DANGERS AND OPPORTUNITIES:

Setting constraints can lead  to undesired  results,  like ill-conditioned
behavior, or inconsistency being detected. From the other side,  it allows
us to improve quality of the fit. Here we summarize  our  experience  with
constrained regression splines:
* excessive constraints can be inconsistent. Splines are  piecewise  cubic
  functions, and it is easy to create an example, where  large  number  of
  constraints  concentrated  in  small  area will result in inconsistency.
  Just because spline is not flexible enough to satisfy all of  them.  And
  same constraints spread across the  [min(x),max(x)]  will  be  perfectly
  consistent.
* the more evenly constraints are spread across [min(x),max(x)],  the more
  chances that they will be consistent
* the  greater  is  M (given  fixed  constraints),  the  more chances that
  constraints will be consistent
* in the general case, consistency of constraints IS NOT GUARANTEED.
* in the several special cases, however, we CAN guarantee consistency.
* one of this cases is constraints  on  the  function  values  AND/OR  its
  derivatives at the interval boundaries.
* another  special  case  is ONE constraint on the function value (OR, but
  not AND, derivative) anywhere in the interval

Our final recommendation is to use constraints  WHEN  AND  ONLY  WHEN  you
can't solve your task without them. Anything beyond  special  cases  given
above is not guaranteed and may result in inconsistency.

Mann-Whitney U-test

This test checks hypotheses about whether X  and  Y  are  samples  of  two
continuous distributions of the same shape  and  same  median  or  whether
their medians are different.

The following tests are performed:
    * two-tailed test (null hypothesis - the medians are equal)
    * left-tailed test (null hypothesis - the median of the  first  sample
      is greater than or equal to the median of the second sample)
    * right-tailed test (null hypothesis - the median of the first  sample
      is less than or equal to the median of the second sample).

Requirements:
    * the samples are independent
    * X and Y are continuous distributions (or discrete distributions well-
      approximating continuous distributions)
    * distributions of X and Y have the  same  shape.  The  only  possible
      difference is their position (i.e. the value of the median)
    * the number of elements in each sample is not less than 5
    * the scale of measurement should be ordinal, interval or ratio  (i.e.
      the test could not be applied to nominal variables).

The test is non-parametric and doesn't require distributions to be normal.

Input parameters:
    X   -   sample 1. Array whose index goes from 0 to N-1.
    N   -   size of the sample. N&gt;=5
    Y   -   sample 2. Array whose index goes from 0 to M-1.
    M   -   size of the sample. M&gt;=5

Output parameters:
    BothTails   -   p-value for two-tailed test.
                    If BothTails is less than the given significance level
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
    LeftTail    -   p-value for left-tailed test.
                    If LeftTail is less than the given significance level,
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
    RightTail   -   p-value for right-tailed test.
                    If RightTail is less than the given significance level
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.

To calculate p-values, special approximation is used. This method lets  us
calculate p-values with satisfactory  accuracy  in  interval  [0.0001, 1].
There is no approximation outside the [0.0001, 1] interval. Therefore,  if
the significance level outlies this interval, the test returns 0.0001.

Relative precision of approximation of p-value:

N          M          Max.err.   Rms.err.
5..10      N..10      1.4e-02    6.0e-04
5..10      N..100     2.2e-02    5.3e-06
10..15     N..15      1.0e-02    3.2e-04
10..15     N..100     1.0e-02    2.2e-05
15..100    N..100     6.1e-03    2.7e-06

For N,M&gt;100 accuracy checks weren't put into  practice,  but  taking  into
account characteristics of asymptotic approximation used, precision should
not be sharply different from the values for interval [5, 100].

NOTE: P-value approximation was  optimized  for  0.0001&lt;=p&lt;=0.2500.  Thus,
      P's outside of this interval are enforced to these bounds. Say,  you
      may quite often get P equal to exactly 0.25 or 0.0001.

      Speaking short, to generate an (N+1)x(N+1) orthogonal matrix, it:
      * takes an NxN one
      * takes uniformly distributed unit vector of dimension N+1.
      * constructs a Householder reflection from the vector, then applies
        it to the smaller matrix (embedded in the larger size with a 1 at

Triangular matrix inverse (complex)

The subroutine inverts the following types of matrices:
    * upper triangular
    * upper triangular with unit diagonal
    * lower triangular
    * lower triangular with unit diagonal

In case of an upper (lower) triangular matrix,  the  inverse  matrix  will
also be upper (lower) triangular, and after the end of the algorithm,  the
inverse matrix replaces the source matrix. The elements  below (above) the
main diagonal are not changed by the algorithm.

If  the matrix  has a unit diagonal, the inverse matrix also  has  a  unit
diagonal, and the diagonal elements are not passed to the algorithm.

In case of an upper (lower) triangular matrix,  the  inverse  matrix  will
also be upper (lower) triangular, and after the end of the algorithm,  the
inverse matrix replaces the source matrix. The elements  below (above) the
main diagonal are not changed by the algorithm.

If  the matrix  has a unit diagonal, the inverse matrix also  has  a  unit
diagonal, and the diagonal elements are not passed to the algorithm.

This function is used to add bound constraints  on  the  elements  of  the

MCPD solver has four types of constraints which can be placed on P:
* user-specified equality constraints (optional)
* user-specified bound constraints (optional)
* user-specified general linear constraints (optional)
* basic constraints (always present):
  * non-negativity: P[i,j]&gt;=0
  * consistency: every column of P sums to 1.0

Final  constraints  which  are  passed  to  the  underlying  optimizer are
calculated  as  intersection  of all present constraints. For example, you
may specify boundary constraint on P[0,0] and equality one:
    0.1&lt;=P[0,0]&lt;=0.9
    P[0,0]=0.5
Such  combination  of  constraints  will  be  silently  reduced  to  their

This  function  can  be  used to ADD bound constraint for one element of P
without changing constraints for other elements.

You  can  also  use  MCPDSetBC()  function  which  allows to  place  bound
constraints  on arbitrary subset of elements of P.   Set of constraints is
specified  by  BndL/BndU matrices, which may contain arbitrary combination
of finite numbers or infinities (like -INF&lt;x&lt;=0.5 or 0.1&lt;=x&lt;+INF).

These functions (MCPDSetBC and MCPDAddBC) interact as follows:
* there is internal matrix of bound constraints which is stored in the
  MCPD solver
* MCPDSetBC() replaces this matrix by another one (SET)
* MCPDAddBC() modifies one element of this matrix and  leaves  other  ones
  unchanged (ADD)
* thus  MCPDAddBC()  call  preserves  all  modifications  done by previous
  calls,  while  MCPDSetBC()  completely discards all changes  done to the
  equality constraints.

solver will try to model transitions from t=A+1 to t=A+2, t=A+2 to  t=A+3,
t=B+1 to t=B+2, t=B+2 to t=B+3. But it WONT mix these two tracks - i.e. it

1. Track may contain either proportional or population data:
   * with proportional data all rows of XY must sum to 1.0, i.e. we have
     proportions instead of absolute population values
   * with population data rows of XY contain population counts and generally
     do not sum to 1.0 (although they still must be non-negative)

DESCRIPTION:

This function creates MCPD (Markov Chains for Population Data) solver.

This  solver  can  be  used  to find transition matrix P for N-dimensional
prediction  problem  where transition from X[i] to X[i+1] is  modelled  as
    X[i+1] = P*X[i]
where X[i] and X[i+1] are N-dimensional population vectors (components  of
each X are non-negative), and P is a N*N transition matrix (elements of  P
are non-negative, each column sums to 1.0).

Such models arise when when:
* there is some population of individuals
* individuals can have different states
* individuals can transit from one state to another
* population size is constant, i.e. there is no new individuals and no one
  leaves population
* you want to model transitions of individuals from one state into another

USAGE:

Here we give very brief outline of the MCPD. We strongly recommend you  to
read examples in the ALGLIB Reference Manual and to read ALGLIB User Guide
on data analysis which is available at http://www.alglib.net/dataanalysis/

1. User initializes algorithm state with MCPDCreate() call

2. User  adds  one  or  more  tracks -  sequences of states which describe
   evolution of a system being modelled from different starting conditions

3. User may add optional boundary, equality  and/or  linear constraints on
   the coefficients of P by calling one of the following functions:
   * MCPDSetEC() to set equality constraints
   * MCPDSetBC() to set bound constraints
   * MCPDSetLC() to set linear constraints

4. Optionally,  user  may  set  custom  weights  for prediction errors (by
   default, algorithm assigns non-equal, automatically chosen weights  for
   errors in the prediction of different components of X). It can be  done
   with a call of MCPDSetPredictionWeights() function.

5. User calls MCPDSolve() function which takes algorithm  state and
   pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.

6. User calls MCPDResults() to get solution

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N&gt;=1

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:

DESCRIPTION:

This function is a specialized version of MCPDCreate()  function,  and  we
recommend  you  to read comments for this function for general information
about MCPD solver.

This  function  creates  MCPD (Markov Chains for Population  Data)  solver
for &quot;Entry-state&quot; model,  i.e. model  where transition from X[i] to X[i+1]
is modelled as
    X[i+1] = P*X[i]
where
    X[i] and X[i+1] are N-dimensional state vectors
    P is a N*N transition matrix
and  one  selected component of X[] is called &quot;entry&quot; state and is treated
in a special way:
    system state always transits from &quot;entry&quot; state to some another state
    system state can not transit from any state into &quot;entry&quot; state
Such conditions basically mean that row of P which corresponds to  &quot;entry&quot;
state is zero.

Such models arise when:
* there is some population of individuals
* individuals can have different states
* individuals can transit from one state to another
* population size is NOT constant -  at every moment of time there is some
  (unpredictable) amount of &quot;new&quot; individuals, which can transit into  one
  of the states at the next turn, but still no one leaves population
* you want to model transitions of individuals from one state into another
* but you do NOT want to predict amount of &quot;new&quot;  individuals  because  it
  does not depends on individuals already present (hence  system  can  not
  transit INTO entry state - it can only transit FROM it).

This model is discussed  in  more  details  in  the ALGLIB User Guide (see
http://www.alglib.net/dataanalysis/ for more data).

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N&gt;=2
    EntryState- index of entry state, in 0..N-1

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure stores algorithm state

DESCRIPTION:

This function is a specialized version of MCPDCreate()  function,  and  we
recommend  you  to read comments for this function for general information
about MCPD solver.

This  function  creates  MCPD (Markov Chains for Population  Data)  solver
for &quot;Entry-Exit-states&quot; model, i.e. model where  transition  from  X[i] to
X[i+1] is modelled as
    X[i+1] = P*X[i]
where
    X[i] and X[i+1] are N-dimensional state vectors
    P is a N*N transition matrix
one selected component of X[] is called &quot;entry&quot; state and is treated in  a
special way:
    system state always transits from &quot;entry&quot; state to some another state
    system state can not transit from any state into &quot;entry&quot; state
and another one component of X[] is called &quot;exit&quot; state and is treated  in
a special way too:
    system state can transit from any state into &quot;exit&quot; state
    system state can not transit from &quot;exit&quot; state into any other state
    transition operator discards &quot;exit&quot; state (makes it zero at each turn)
Such conditions basically mean that:
    row of P which corresponds to &quot;entry&quot; state is zero
    column of P which corresponds to &quot;exit&quot; state is zero
Multiplication by such P may decrease sum of vector components.

Such models arise when:
* there is some population of individuals
* individuals can have different states
* individuals can transit from one state to another
* population size is NOT constant
* at every moment of time there is some (unpredictable)  amount  of  &quot;new&quot;
  individuals, which can transit into one of the states at the next turn
* some  individuals  can  move  (predictably)  into &quot;exit&quot; state and leave
  population at the next turn
* you want to model transitions of individuals from one state into another,
  including transitions from the &quot;entry&quot; state and into the &quot;exit&quot; state.
* but you do NOT want to predict amount of &quot;new&quot;  individuals  because  it
  does not depends on individuals already present (hence  system  can  not
  transit INTO entry state - it can only transit FROM it).

This model is discussed  in  more  details  in  the ALGLIB User Guide (see
http://www.alglib.net/dataanalysis/ for more data).

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N&gt;=2
    EntryState- index of entry state, in 0..N-1

This function is used to add bound constraints  on  the  elements  of  the
transition matrix P.

MCPD solver has four types of constraints which can be placed on P:
* user-specified equality constraints (optional)
* user-specified bound constraints (optional)
* user-specified general linear constraints (optional)
* basic constraints (always present):
  * non-negativity: P[i,j]&gt;=0
  * consistency: every column of P sums to 1.0

Final  constraints  which  are  passed  to  the  underlying  optimizer are
calculated  as  intersection  of all present constraints. For example, you
may specify boundary constraint on P[0,0] and equality one:
    0.1&lt;=P[0,0]&lt;=0.9
    P[0,0]=0.5
Such  combination  of  constraints  will  be  silently  reduced  to  their
intersection, which is P[0,0]=0.5.

This  function  can  be  used  to  place bound   constraints  on arbitrary
subset  of  elements  of  P.  Set of constraints is specified by BndL/BndU
matrices, which may contain arbitrary combination  of  finite  numbers  or
infinities (like -INF&lt;x&lt;=0.5 or 0.1&lt;=x&lt;+INF).

You can also use MCPDAddBC() function which allows to ADD bound constraint
for one element of P without changing constraints for other elements.

These functions (MCPDSetBC and MCPDAddBC) interact as follows:
* there is internal matrix of bound constraints which is stored in the
  MCPD solver
* MCPDSetBC() replaces this matrix by another one (SET)
* MCPDAddBC() modifies one element of this matrix and  leaves  other  ones
  unchanged (ADD)
* thus  MCPDAddBC()  call  preserves  all  modifications  done by previous
  calls,  while  MCPDSetBC()  completely discards all changes  done to the
  equality constraints.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    S       -   solver
    BndL    -   lower bounds constraints, array[N,N]. Elements of BndL can
                be finite numbers or -INF.
    BndU    -   upper bounds constraints, array[N,N]. Elements of BndU can
                be finite numbers or +INF.

This function is used to set linear equality/inequality constraints on the
elements of the transition matrix P.

This function can be used to set one or several general linear constraints
on the elements of P. Two types of constraints are supported:
* equality constraints
* inequality constraints (both less-or-equal and greater-or-equal)

Coefficients  of  constraints  are  specified  by  matrix  C (one  of  the
parameters).  One  row  of  C  corresponds  to  one  constraint.   Because
transition  matrix P has N*N elements,  we  need  N*N columns to store all
coefficients  (they  are  stored row by row), and one more column to store
right part - hence C has N*N+1 columns.  Constraint  kind is stored in the
CT array.

Thus, I-th linear constraint is
    P[0,0]*C[I,0] + P[0,1]*C[I,1] + .. + P[0,N-1]*C[I,N-1] +
        + P[1,0]*C[I,N] + P[1,1]*C[I,N+1] + ... +
        + P[N-1,N-1]*C[I,N*N-1]  ?=?  C[I,N*N]
where ?=? can be either &quot;=&quot; (CT[i]=0), &quot;&lt;=&quot; (CT[i]&lt;0) or &quot;&gt;=&quot; (CT[i]&gt;0).

Your constraint may involve only some subset of P (less than N*N elements).
For example it can be something like
    P[0,0] + P[0,1] = 0.5
In this case you still should pass matrix  with N*N+1 columns, but all its
elements (except for C[0,0], C[0,1] and C[0,N*N-1]) will be zero.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    S       -   solver
    C       -   array[K,N*N+1] - coefficients of constraints
                (see above for complete description)
    CT      -   array[K] - constraint types
                (see above for complete description)
    K       -   number of equality/inequality constraints, K&gt;=0:
                * if given, only leading K elements of C/CT are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from sizes of C/CT

                     BOX CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION
          WITH FAST ACTIVATION OF MULTIPLE BOX CONSTRAINTS

DESCRIPTION:
The  subroutine  minimizes  function   F(x) of N arguments subject  to box
constraints (with some of box constraints actually being equality ones).

This optimizer uses algorithm similar to that of MinBLEIC (optimizer  with
general linear constraints), but presence of box-only  constraints  allows
us to use faster constraint activation strategies. On large-scale problems,
with multiple constraints active at the solution, this  optimizer  can  be
several times faster than BLEIC.

REQUIREMENTS:
* user must provide function value and gradient
* starting point X0 must be feasible or
  not too far away from the feasible set
* grad(f) must be Lipschitz continuous on a level set:
  L = { x : f(x)&lt;=f(x0) }
* function must be defined everywhere on the feasible set F

USAGE:

Constrained optimization if far more complex than the unconstrained one.
Here we give very brief outline of the BC optimizer. We strongly recommend
you to read examples in the ALGLIB Reference Manual and to read ALGLIB User Guide
on optimization, which is available at http://www.alglib.net/optimization/

1. User initializes algorithm state with MinBCCreate() call

2. USer adds box constraints by calling MinBCSetBC() function.

3. User sets stopping conditions with MinBCSetCond().

4. User calls MinBCOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state and
   pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.

5. User calls MinBCResults() to get solution

6. Optionally user may call MinBCRestartFrom() to solve another problem
   with same N but another starting point.
   MinBCRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N&gt;0:
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size ofX
    X       -   starting point, array[N]:
                * it is better to set X to a feasible point
                * but X can be infeasible, in which case algorithm will try
                  to find feasible point first, using X as initial
                  approximation.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure stores algorithm state

The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinBCCreate().  It  uses
finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

Description below contains information which is specific to  this function
only. We recommend to read comments on MinBCCreate() in  order  to  get
more information about creation of BC optimizer.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N&gt;0:
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
    X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
    DiffStep-   differentiation step, &gt;0

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

NOTES:
1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
   S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinBCSetScale() call.
3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
   large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
   step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
   value to start with.
4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
   calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
   any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
   However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
   small ones.
   We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
   is  less  robust and precise. CG needs exact gradient values. Imprecise
   gradient may slow  down  convergence, especially  on  highly  nonlinear
   problems.
   Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
   dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
   as possible.

This  function  activates/deactivates verification  of  the  user-supplied
analytic gradient.

Upon  activation  of  this  option  OptGuard  integrity  checker  performs
numerical differentiation of your target function  at  the  initial  point
(note: future versions may also perform check  at  the  final  point)  and
compares numerical gradient with analytic one provided by you.

If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization  session
continues. After optimization session is over, you can retrieve the report
which  stores  both  gradients  and  specific  components  highlighted  as
suspicious by the OptGuard.

The primary OptGuard report can be retrieved with minbcoptguardresults().

IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you
           about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases it may
           cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.

           YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT IN THE PRODUCTION CODE UNLESS YOU WANT TO
           CHECK DERIVATIVES PROVIDED BY SOME THIRD PARTY.

NOTE: unlike previous incarnation of the gradient checking code,  OptGuard
      does NOT interrupt optimization even if it discovers bad gradient.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State       -   structure used to store algorithm state
    TestStep    -   verification step used for numerical differentiation:
                    * TestStep=0 turns verification off
                    * TestStep&gt;0 activates verification
                    You should carefully choose TestStep. Value  which  is
                    too large (so large that  function  behavior  is  non-
                    cubic at this scale) will lead  to  false  alarms. Too
                    short step will result in rounding  errors  dominating
                    numerical derivative.

                    You may use different step for different parameters by
                    means of setting scale with minbcsetscale().

=== EXPLANATION ==========================================================

In order to verify gradient algorithm performs following steps:
  * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and X[i]+TestStep*S[i],
    where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
    of i-th parameter
  * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
  * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
  * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
    points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
    point

This test is less powerful than test #1, but it does  not  depend  on  the
gradient values and thus it is more robust against artifacts introduced by
numerical differentiation.

Two reports are returned:

  value of the nonsmoothness indicator
* a &quot;longest&quot; one, corresponding to line search which  had  more  function
  evaluations, and thus is more detailed

In both cases following fields are returned:

* positive - is TRUE  when test flagged suspicious point;  FALSE  if  test
  did not notice anything (in the latter cases fields below are empty).
* x0[], d[] - arrays of length N which store initial point  and  direction
  for line search (d[] can be normalized, but does not have to)
* stp[], f[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths and  function

Detailed results of the OptGuard integrity check for nonsmoothness test #1

Nonsmoothness (non-C1)  test  #1  studies  individual  components  of  the
gradient computed during line search.

When precise analytic gradient is provided this test is more powerful than
test #0  which  works  with  function  values  and  ignores  user-provided
gradient.  However,  test  #0  becomes  more   powerful   when   numerical
differentiation is employed (in such cases test #1 detects  higher  levels
of numerical noise and becomes too conservative).

This test also tells specific components of the gradient which violate  C1
continuity, which makes it more informative than #0, which just tells that
continuity is violated.

Two reports are returned:
* a &quot;strongest&quot; one, corresponding  to  line   search  which  had  highest
  value of the nonsmoothness indicator
* a &quot;longest&quot; one, corresponding to line search which  had  more  function
  evaluations, and thus is more detailed

In both cases following fields are returned:

* positive - is TRUE  when test flagged suspicious point;  FALSE  if  test
  did not notice anything (in the latter cases fields below are empty).
* vidx - is an index of the variable in [0,N) with nonsmooth derivative
* x0[], d[] - arrays of length N which store initial point  and  direction
  for line search (d[] can be normalized, but does not have to)
* stp[], g[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths and  gradient
  values at these points; g[i] is evaluated in  x0+stp[i]*d  and  contains
  vidx-th component of the gradient.

Results of OptGuard integrity check, should be called  after  optimization
session is over.

=== PRIMARY REPORT =======================================================

OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch common errors
in the implementation of nonlinear function/gradient:
* incorrect analytic gradient
* discontinuous (non-C0) target functions (constraints)
* nonsmooth     (non-C1) target functions (constraints)

Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:
* minbcoptguardgradient() for gradient verification
* minbcoptguardsmoothness() for C0/C1 checks

Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
* rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
  * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (gradient element) suspected
  * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient is tested
  * rep.badgraduser, user-provided gradient  (stored  as  2D  matrix  with
    single row in order to make  report  structure  compatible  with  more
    complex optimizers like MinNLC or MinLM)
  * rep.badgradnum,   reference    gradient    obtained    via   numerical
    differentiation (stored as  2D matrix with single row in order to make
    report structure compatible with more complex optimizers  like  MinNLC
    or MinLM)
* rep.nonc0suspected
* rep.nonc1suspected

=== ADDITIONAL REPORTS/LOGS ==============================================

Several different tests are performed to catch C0/C1 errors, you can  find
out specific test signaled error by looking to:
* rep.nonc0test0positive, for non-C0 test #0
* rep.nonc1test0positive, for non-C1 test #0
* rep.nonc1test1positive, for non-C1 test #1

Additional information (including line search logs)  can  be  obtained  by
means of:
* minbcoptguardnonc1test0results()
* minbcoptguardnonc1test1results()
which return detailed error reports, specific points where discontinuities
were found, and so on.

==========================================================================

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    state   -   algorithm state

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    rep     -   generic OptGuard report;  more  detailed  reports  can  be
                retrieved with other functions.

NOTE: false negatives (nonsmooth problems are not identified as  nonsmooth
      ones) are possible although unlikely.

      The reason  is  that  you  need  to  make several evaluations around
      nonsmoothness  in  order  to  accumulate  enough  information  about
      function curvature. Say, if you start right from the nonsmooth point,
      optimizer simply won't get enough data to understand what  is  going
      wrong before it terminates due to abrupt changes in the  derivative.
      It is also  possible  that  &quot;unlucky&quot;  step  will  move  us  to  the
      termination too quickly.

      Our current approach is to have less than 0.1%  false  negatives  in
      our test examples  (measured  with  multiple  restarts  from  random
      points), and to have exactly 0% false positives.

<div style='color: green; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;'>/*************************************************************************
This  function  activates/deactivates nonsmoothness monitoring  option  of
the  OptGuard  integrity  checker. Smoothness  monitor  silently  observes
solution process and tries to detect ill-posed problems, i.e. ones with:
a) discontinuous target function (non-C0)
b) nonsmooth     target function (non-C1)

Smoothness monitoring does NOT interrupt optimization  even if it suspects
that your problem is nonsmooth. It just sets corresponding  flags  in  the
OptGuard report which can be retrieved after optimization is over.

Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often adds  less
than 1% to the optimizer running time. Thus, you can use it even for large
scale problems.

NOTE: OptGuard does  NOT  guarantee  that  it  will  always  detect  C0/C1
      continuity violations.

      First, minor errors are hard to  catch - say, a 0.0001 difference in
      the model values at two sides of the gap may be due to discontinuity
      of the model - or simply because the model has changed.

      Second, C1-violations  are  especially  difficult  to  detect  in  a
      noninvasive way. The optimizer usually  performs  very  short  steps
      near the nonsmoothness, and differentiation  usually   introduces  a
      lot of numerical noise.  It  is  hard  to  tell  whether  some  tiny
      discontinuity in the slope is due to real nonsmoothness or just  due
      to numerical noise alone.

      Our top priority was to avoid false positives, so in some rare cases
      minor errors may went unnoticed (however, in most cases they can  be
      spotted with restart from different initial point).

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    state   -   algorithm state
    level   -   monitoring level:
                * 0 - monitoring is disabled
                * 1 - noninvasive low-overhead monitoring; function values
                      and/or gradients are recorded, but OptGuard does not
                      try to perform additional evaluations  in  order  to
                      get more information about suspicious locations.

=== EXPLANATION ==========================================================

One major source of headache during optimization  is  the  possibility  of
the coding errors in the target function/constraints (or their gradients).
Such  errors   most   often   manifest   themselves  as  discontinuity  or
nonsmoothness of the target/constraints.

Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something involving
lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth target. Although not  a
coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway - and smooth  optimizers  usually
stop right after encountering nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.

OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations: it monitors
function values/gradients being passed  to  the  optimizer  and  tries  to
errors. Upon discovering suspicious pair of points it  raises  appropriate
flag (and allows you to continue optimization). When optimization is done,
you can study OptGuard result.

This family of functions is used to launcn iterations of nonlinear optimizer

These functions accept following parameters:
    state   -   algorithm state
    func    -   callback which calculates function (or merit function)
                value func at given point x
    grad    -   callback which calculates function (or merit function)
                value func and gradient grad at given point x
    rep     -   optional callback which is called after each iteration
                can be NULL
    ptr     -   optional pointer which is passed to func/grad/hess/jac/rep
                can be NULL

NOTES:

1. This function has two different implementations: one which  uses  exact
   (analytical) user-supplied gradient,  and one which uses function value
   only  and  numerically  differentiates  function  in  order  to  obtain
   gradient.

   Depending  on  the  specific  function  used to create optimizer object
   (either  MinBCCreate() for analytical gradient or  MinBCCreateF()
   for numerical differentiation) you should choose appropriate variant of
   MinBCOptimize() - one  which  accepts  function  AND gradient or one
   which accepts function ONLY.

   Be careful to choose variant of MinBCOptimize() which corresponds to
   your optimization scheme! Table below lists different  combinations  of
   callback (function/gradient) passed to MinBCOptimize()  and specific
   function used to create optimizer.

   MinBCCreate()     |     FAILS               works

   Here &quot;FAIL&quot; denotes inappropriate combinations  of  optimizer  creation
   function  and  MinBCOptimize()  version.   Attemps   to   use   such
   combination (for  example,  to  create optimizer with MinBCCreateF()
   and  to  pass  gradient  information  to  MinCGOptimize()) will lead to
   exception being thrown. Either  you  did  not pass gradient when it WAS
   needed or you passed gradient when it was NOT needed.

                The  subroutine  finishes  its work if on k+1-th iteration
                the  condition  |F(k+1)-F(k)|&lt;=EpsF*max{|F(k)|,|F(k+1)|,1}
                is satisfied.
    EpsX    -   &gt;=0
                The subroutine finishes its work if  on  k+1-th  iteration
                the condition |v|&lt;=EpsX is fulfilled, where:
                * |.| means Euclidian norm

                * s - scaling coefficients set by MinBCSetScale()
    MaxIts  -   maximum number of iterations. If MaxIts=0, the  number  of
                iterations is unlimited.

Passing EpsG=0, EpsF=0 and EpsX=0 and MaxIts=0 (simultaneously) will lead
to automatic stopping criterion selection.

NOTE: when SetCond() called with non-zero MaxIts, BC solver may perform
      slightly more than MaxIts iterations. I.e., MaxIts  sets  non-strict
      limit on iterations count.

Modification of the preconditioner: scale-based diagonal preconditioning.

This preconditioning mode can be useful when you  don't  have  approximate
diagonal of Hessian, but you know that your  variables  are  badly  scaled
(for  example,  one  variable is in [1,10], and another in [1000,100000]),
and most part of the ill-conditioning comes from different scales of vars.

In this case simple  scale-based  preconditioner,  with H[i] = 1/(s[i]^2),
can greatly improve convergence.

IMPRTANT: you should set scale of your variables  with  MinBCSetScale()
call  (before  or after MinBCSetPrecScale() call). Without knowledge of
the scale of your variables scale-based preconditioner will be  just  unit
matrix.

This function sets scaling coefficients for BC optimizer.

ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
a) &quot;how large&quot; the variable is
b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of the optimizer  - step
along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

In  most  optimizers  (and  in  the  BC  too)  scaling is NOT a form of
preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
preconditioner  by  separate  call  to  one  of  the  MinBCSetPrec...()
functions.

There is a special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
forms of tuning solver.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure stores algorithm state
    S       -   array[N], non-zero scaling coefficients

                     BOUND CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION
       WITH ADDITIONAL LINEAR EQUALITY AND INEQUALITY CONSTRAINTS

DESCRIPTION:
The  subroutine  minimizes  function   F(x)  of N arguments subject to any
combination of:
* bound constraints
* linear inequality constraints
* linear equality constraints

REQUIREMENTS:
* user must provide function value and gradient
* starting point X0 must be feasible or
  not too far away from the feasible set
* grad(f) must be Lipschitz continuous on a level set:
  L = { x : f(x)&lt;=f(x0) }
* function must be defined everywhere on the feasible set F

USAGE:

Constrained optimization if far more complex than the unconstrained one.
Here we give very brief outline of the BLEIC optimizer. We strongly recommend
you to read examples in the ALGLIB Reference Manual and to read ALGLIB User Guide
on optimization, which is available at http://www.alglib.net/optimization/

1. User initializes algorithm state with MinBLEICCreate() call

2. USer adds boundary and/or linear constraints by calling
   MinBLEICSetBC() and MinBLEICSetLC() functions.

3. User sets stopping conditions with MinBLEICSetCond().

4. User calls MinBLEICOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state and
   pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.

5. User calls MinBLEICResults() to get solution

6. Optionally user may call MinBLEICRestartFrom() to solve another problem
   with same N but another starting point.
   MinBLEICRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.

NOTE: if you have box-only constraints (no  general  linear  constraints),
      then MinBC optimizer can be better option. It uses  special,  faster
      constraint activation method, which performs better on problems with
      multiple constraints active at the solution.

      On small-scale problems performance of MinBC is similar to  that  of
      MinBLEIC, but on large-scale ones (hundreds and thousands of  active
      constraints) it can be several times faster than MinBLEIC.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N&gt;0:
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size ofX
    X       -   starting point, array[N]:
                * it is better to set X to a feasible point
                * but X can be infeasible, in which case algorithm will try
                  to find feasible point first, using X as initial
                  approximation.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure stores algorithm state

The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinBLEICCreate().  It  uses
finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

Description below contains information which is specific to  this function
only. We recommend to read comments on MinBLEICCreate() in  order  to  get
more information about creation of BLEIC optimizer.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N&gt;0:
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
    X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
    DiffStep-   differentiation step, &gt;0

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

NOTES:
1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
   S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinBLEICSetScale() call.
3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
   large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
   step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
   value to start with.
4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
   calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
   any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
   However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
   small ones.
   We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
   is  less  robust and precise. CG needs exact gradient values. Imprecise
   gradient may slow  down  convergence, especially  on  highly  nonlinear
   problems.
   Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
   dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
   as possible.

This  function  activates/deactivates verification  of  the  user-supplied
analytic gradient.

Upon  activation  of  this  option  OptGuard  integrity  checker  performs
numerical differentiation of your target function  at  the  initial  point
(note: future versions may also perform check  at  the  final  point)  and
compares numerical gradient with analytic one provided by you.

If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization  session
continues. After optimization session is over, you can retrieve the report
which  stores  both  gradients  and  specific  components  highlighted  as
suspicious by the OptGuard.

The primary OptGuard report can be retrieved with minbleicoptguardresults().

IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you
           about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases it may
           cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.

           YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT IN THE PRODUCTION CODE UNLESS YOU WANT TO
           CHECK DERIVATIVES PROVIDED BY SOME THIRD PARTY.

NOTE: unlike previous incarnation of the gradient checking code,  OptGuard
      does NOT interrupt optimization even if it discovers bad gradient.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State       -   structure used to store algorithm state
    TestStep    -   verification step used for numerical differentiation:
                    * TestStep=0 turns verification off
                    * TestStep&gt;0 activates verification
                    You should carefully choose TestStep. Value  which  is
                    too large (so large that  function  behavior  is  non-
                    cubic at this scale) will lead  to  false  alarms. Too
                    short step will result in rounding  errors  dominating
                    numerical derivative.

                    You may use different step for different parameters by
                    means of setting scale with minbleicsetscale().

=== EXPLANATION ==========================================================

In order to verify gradient algorithm performs following steps:
  * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and X[i]+TestStep*S[i],
    where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
    of i-th parameter
  * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
  * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
  * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
    points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
    point

Results of OptGuard integrity check, should be called  after  optimization
session is over.

=== PRIMARY REPORT =======================================================

OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch common errors
in the implementation of nonlinear function/gradient:
* incorrect analytic gradient
* discontinuous (non-C0) target functions (constraints)
* nonsmooth     (non-C1) target functions (constraints)

Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:
* minbleicoptguardgradient() for gradient verification
* minbleicoptguardsmoothness() for C0/C1 checks

Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
* rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
  * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (gradient element) suspected
  * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient is tested
  * rep.badgraduser, user-provided gradient  (stored  as  2D  matrix  with
    single row in order to make  report  structure  compatible  with  more
    complex optimizers like MinNLC or MinLM)
  * rep.badgradnum,   reference    gradient    obtained    via   numerical
    differentiation (stored as  2D matrix with single row in order to make
    report structure compatible with more complex optimizers  like  MinNLC
    or MinLM)
* rep.nonc0suspected
* rep.nonc1suspected

=== ADDITIONAL REPORTS/LOGS ==============================================

Several different tests are performed to catch C0/C1 errors, you can  find
out specific test signaled error by looking to:
* rep.nonc0test0positive, for non-C0 test #0
* rep.nonc1test0positive, for non-C1 test #0
* rep.nonc1test1positive, for non-C1 test #1

Additional information (including line search logs)  can  be  obtained  by
means of:
* minbleicoptguardnonc1test0results()
* minbleicoptguardnonc1test1results()
which return detailed error reports, specific points where discontinuities
were found, and so on.

==========================================================================

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    state   -   algorithm state

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    rep     -   generic OptGuard report;  more  detailed  reports  can  be
                retrieved with other functions.

NOTE: false negatives (nonsmooth problems are not identified as  nonsmooth
      ones) are possible although unlikely.

      The reason  is  that  you  need  to  make several evaluations around
      nonsmoothness  in  order  to  accumulate  enough  information  about
      function curvature. Say, if you start right from the nonsmooth point,
      optimizer simply won't get enough data to understand what  is  going
      wrong before it terminates due to abrupt changes in the  derivative.
      It is also  possible  that  &quot;unlucky&quot;  step  will  move  us  to  the
      termination too quickly.

      Our current approach is to have less than 0.1%  false  negatives  in
      our test examples  (measured  with  multiple  restarts  from  random
      points), and to have exactly 0% false positives.

<div style='color: green; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;'>/*************************************************************************
This  function  activates/deactivates nonsmoothness monitoring  option  of
the  OptGuard  integrity  checker. Smoothness  monitor  silently  observes
solution process and tries to detect ill-posed problems, i.e. ones with:
a) discontinuous target function (non-C0)
b) nonsmooth     target function (non-C1)

Smoothness monitoring does NOT interrupt optimization  even if it suspects
that your problem is nonsmooth. It just sets corresponding  flags  in  the
OptGuard report which can be retrieved after optimization is over.

Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often adds  less
than 1% to the optimizer running time. Thus, you can use it even for large
scale problems.

NOTE: OptGuard does  NOT  guarantee  that  it  will  always  detect  C0/C1
      continuity violations.

      First, minor errors are hard to  catch - say, a 0.0001 difference in
      the model values at two sides of the gap may be due to discontinuity
      of the model - or simply because the model has changed.

      Second, C1-violations  are  especially  difficult  to  detect  in  a
      noninvasive way. The optimizer usually  performs  very  short  steps
      near the nonsmoothness, and differentiation  usually   introduces  a
      lot of numerical noise.  It  is  hard  to  tell  whether  some  tiny
      discontinuity in the slope is due to real nonsmoothness or just  due
      to numerical noise alone.

      Our top priority was to avoid false positives, so in some rare cases
      minor errors may went unnoticed (however, in most cases they can  be
      spotted with restart from different initial point).

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    state   -   algorithm state
    level   -   monitoring level:
                * 0 - monitoring is disabled
                * 1 - noninvasive low-overhead monitoring; function values
                      and/or gradients are recorded, but OptGuard does not
                      try to perform additional evaluations  in  order  to
                      get more information about suspicious locations.

=== EXPLANATION ==========================================================

One major source of headache during optimization  is  the  possibility  of
the coding errors in the target function/constraints (or their gradients).
Such  errors   most   often   manifest   themselves  as  discontinuity  or
nonsmoothness of the target/constraints.

Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something involving
lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth target. Although not  a
coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway - and smooth  optimizers  usually
stop right after encountering nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.

OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations: it monitors
function values/gradients being passed  to  the  optimizer  and  tries  to
errors. Upon discovering suspicious pair of points it  raises  appropriate
flag (and allows you to continue optimization). When optimization is done,
you can study OptGuard result.

This family of functions is used to launcn iterations of nonlinear optimizer

These functions accept following parameters:
    state   -   algorithm state
    func    -   callback which calculates function (or merit function)
                value func at given point x
    grad    -   callback which calculates function (or merit function)
                value func and gradient grad at given point x
    rep     -   optional callback which is called after each iteration
                can be NULL
    ptr     -   optional pointer which is passed to func/grad/hess/jac/rep
                can be NULL

NOTES:

1. This function has two different implementations: one which  uses  exact
   (analytical) user-supplied gradient,  and one which uses function value
   only  and  numerically  differentiates  function  in  order  to  obtain
   gradient.

   Depending  on  the  specific  function  used to create optimizer object
   (either  MinBLEICCreate() for analytical gradient or  MinBLEICCreateF()
   for numerical differentiation) you should choose appropriate variant of
   MinBLEICOptimize() - one  which  accepts  function  AND gradient or one
   which accepts function ONLY.

   Be careful to choose variant of MinBLEICOptimize() which corresponds to
   your optimization scheme! Table below lists different  combinations  of
   callback (function/gradient) passed to MinBLEICOptimize()  and specific
   function used to create optimizer.


                     |         USER PASSED TO MinBLEICOptimize()
   CREATED WITH      |  function only   |  function and gradient

   MinBLEICCreateF() |     work                FAIL
   MinBLEICCreate()  |     FAIL                work

   Here &quot;FAIL&quot; denotes inappropriate combinations  of  optimizer  creation
   function  and  MinBLEICOptimize()  version.   Attemps   to   use   such
   combination (for  example,  to  create optimizer with MinBLEICCreateF()
   and  to  pass  gradient information to MinBLEICOptimize()) will lead to
   exception being thrown. Either  you  did  not pass gradient when it WAS
   needed or you passed gradient when it was NOT needed.

Boundary constraints are inactive by default (after initial creation).

NOTE: if you have box-only constraints (no  general  linear  constraints),

      multiple constraints active at the solution.

      On small-scale problems performance of MinBC is similar to  that  of

problem  in  such  manner  that  all constraints will become boundary ones
(this kind of constraints is always satisfied exactly, both in  the  final
solution and in all intermediate points).

    D       -   diagonal of the approximate Hessian, array[0..N-1],
                (if larger, only leading N elements are used).

NOTE 1: D[i] should be positive. Exception will be thrown otherwise.

NOTE 2: you should pass diagonal of approximate Hessian - NOT ITS INVERSE.

Modification of the preconditioner: scale-based diagonal preconditioning.

This preconditioning mode can be useful when you  don't  have  approximate
diagonal of Hessian, but you know that your  variables  are  badly  scaled
(for  example,  one  variable is in [1,10], and another in [1000,100000]),
and most part of the ill-conditioning comes from different scales of vars.

In this case simple  scale-based  preconditioner,  with H[i] = 1/(s[i]^2),
can greatly improve convergence.

IMPRTANT: you should set scale of your variables  with  MinBLEICSetScale()
call  (before  or after MinBLEICSetPrecScale() call). Without knowledge of
the scale of your variables scale-based preconditioner will be  just  unit
matrix.

This function sets scaling coefficients for BLEIC optimizer.

ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
a) &quot;how large&quot; the variable is
b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of the optimizer  - step
along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

In  most  optimizers  (and  in  the  BLEIC  too)  scaling is NOT a form of
preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
preconditioner  by  separate  call  to  one  of  the  MinBLEICSetPrec...()
functions.

There is a special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
forms of tuning solver.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure stores algorithm state
    S       -   array[N], non-zero scaling coefficients
                S[i] may be negative, sign doesn't matter.

This function sets maximum step length

IMPORTANT: this feature is hard to combine with preconditioning. You can't
set upper limit on step length, when you solve optimization  problem  with
linear (non-boundary) constraints AND preconditioner turned on.

When  non-boundary  constraints  are  present,  you  have to either a) use
preconditioner, or b) use upper limit on step length.  YOU CAN'T USE BOTH!
In this case algorithm will terminate with appropriate error code.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state
    StpMax  -   maximum step length, &gt;=0. Set StpMax to 0.0,  if you don't
                want to limit step length.

Use this subroutine when you optimize target function which contains exp()
or  other  fast  growing  functions,  and optimization algorithm makes too
large  steps  which  lead   to overflow. This function allows us to reject
steps  that  are  too  large  (and  therefore  expose  us  to the possible
overflow) without actually calculating function value at the x+stp*d.

        NONLINEAR CONJUGATE GRADIENT METHOD

DESCRIPTION:
The subroutine minimizes function F(x) of N arguments by using one of  the
nonlinear conjugate gradient methods.

These CG methods are globally convergent (even on non-convex functions) as
long as grad(f) is Lipschitz continuous in  a  some  neighborhood  of  the
L = { x : f(x)&lt;=f(x0) }.


REQUIREMENTS:
Algorithm will request following information during its operation:
* function value F and its gradient G (simultaneously) at given point X


USAGE:
1. User initializes algorithm state with MinCGCreate() call
2. User tunes solver parameters with MinCGSetCond(), MinCGSetStpMax() and
   other functions
3. User calls MinCGOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state   and
   pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.
4. User calls MinCGResults() to get solution
5. Optionally, user may call MinCGRestartFrom() to solve another  problem
   with same N but another starting point and/or another function.
   MinCGRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N&gt;0:
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
    X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinCGCreate(). It uses
finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

Description below contains information which is specific to this function
only. We recommend to read comments on MinCGCreate() in order to get more
information about creation of CG optimizer.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N&gt;0:
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
    X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
    DiffStep-   differentiation step, &gt;0

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

NOTES:
1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
   S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinCGSetScale() call.
3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
   large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
   step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
   value to start with.
4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
   calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
   any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
   However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
   small ones.
   We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
   is  less  robust  and  precise.  L-BFGS  needs  exact  gradient values.
   Imprecise  gradient may slow down  convergence,  especially  on  highly
   nonlinear problems.
   Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
   dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
   as possible.

This  function  activates/deactivates verification  of  the  user-supplied
analytic gradient.

Upon  activation  of  this  option  OptGuard  integrity  checker  performs
numerical differentiation of your target function  at  the  initial  point
(note: future versions may also perform check  at  the  final  point)  and
compares numerical gradient with analytic one provided by you.

If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization  session
continues. After optimization session is over, you can retrieve the report
which  stores  both  gradients  and  specific  components  highlighted  as
suspicious by the OptGuard.

The primary OptGuard report can be retrieved with mincgoptguardresults().

IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you
           about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases it may
           cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.

           YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT IN THE PRODUCTION CODE UNLESS YOU WANT TO
           CHECK DERIVATIVES PROVIDED BY SOME THIRD PARTY.

NOTE: unlike previous incarnation of the gradient checking code,  OptGuard
      does NOT interrupt optimization even if it discovers bad gradient.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State       -   structure used to store algorithm state
    TestStep    -   verification step used for numerical differentiation:
                    * TestStep=0 turns verification off
                    * TestStep&gt;0 activates verification
                    You should carefully choose TestStep. Value  which  is
                    too large (so large that  function  behavior  is  non-
                    cubic at this scale) will lead  to  false  alarms. Too
                    short step will result in rounding  errors  dominating
                    numerical derivative.

                    You may use different step for different parameters by
                    means of setting scale with mincgsetscale().

=== EXPLANATION ==========================================================

In order to verify gradient algorithm performs following steps:
  * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and X[i]+TestStep*S[i],
    where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
    of i-th parameter
  * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
  * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
  * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
    points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
    point

Results of OptGuard integrity check, should be called  after  optimization
session is over.

=== PRIMARY REPORT =======================================================

OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch common errors
in the implementation of nonlinear function/gradient:
* incorrect analytic gradient
* discontinuous (non-C0) target functions (constraints)
* nonsmooth     (non-C1) target functions (constraints)

Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:
* mincgoptguardgradient() for gradient verification
* mincgoptguardsmoothness() for C0/C1 checks

Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
* rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
  * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (gradient element) suspected
  * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient is tested
  * rep.badgraduser, user-provided gradient  (stored  as  2D  matrix  with
    single row in order to make  report  structure  compatible  with  more
    complex optimizers like MinNLC or MinLM)
  * rep.badgradnum,   reference    gradient    obtained    via   numerical
    differentiation (stored as  2D matrix with single row in order to make
    report structure compatible with more complex optimizers  like  MinNLC
    or MinLM)
* rep.nonc0suspected
* rep.nonc1suspected

=== ADDITIONAL REPORTS/LOGS ==============================================

Several different tests are performed to catch C0/C1 errors, you can  find
out specific test signaled error by looking to:
* rep.nonc0test0positive, for non-C0 test #0
* rep.nonc1test0positive, for non-C1 test #0
* rep.nonc1test1positive, for non-C1 test #1

Additional information (including line search logs)  can  be  obtained  by
means of:
* mincgoptguardnonc1test0results()
* mincgoptguardnonc1test1results()
which return detailed error reports, specific points where discontinuities
were found, and so on.

==========================================================================

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    state   -   algorithm state

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    rep     -   generic OptGuard report;  more  detailed  reports  can  be
                retrieved with other functions.

NOTE: false negatives (nonsmooth problems are not identified as  nonsmooth
      ones) are possible although unlikely.

      The reason  is  that  you  need  to  make several evaluations around
      nonsmoothness  in  order  to  accumulate  enough  information  about
      function curvature. Say, if you start right from the nonsmooth point,
      optimizer simply won't get enough data to understand what  is  going
      wrong before it terminates due to abrupt changes in the  derivative.
      It is also  possible  that  &quot;unlucky&quot;  step  will  move  us  to  the
      termination too quickly.

      Our current approach is to have less than 0.1%  false  negatives  in
      our test examples  (measured  with  multiple  restarts  from  random
      points), and to have exactly 0% false positives.

<div style='color: green; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;'>/*************************************************************************
This  function  activates/deactivates nonsmoothness monitoring  option  of
the  OptGuard  integrity  checker. Smoothness  monitor  silently  observes
solution process and tries to detect ill-posed problems, i.e. ones with:
a) discontinuous target function (non-C0)
b) nonsmooth     target function (non-C1)

Smoothness monitoring does NOT interrupt optimization  even if it suspects
that your problem is nonsmooth. It just sets corresponding  flags  in  the
OptGuard report which can be retrieved after optimization is over.

Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often adds  less
than 1% to the optimizer running time. Thus, you can use it even for large
scale problems.

NOTE: OptGuard does  NOT  guarantee  that  it  will  always  detect  C0/C1
      continuity violations.

      First, minor errors are hard to  catch - say, a 0.0001 difference in
      the model values at two sides of the gap may be due to discontinuity
      of the model - or simply because the model has changed.

      Second, C1-violations  are  especially  difficult  to  detect  in  a
      noninvasive way. The optimizer usually  performs  very  short  steps
      near the nonsmoothness, and differentiation  usually   introduces  a
      lot of numerical noise.  It  is  hard  to  tell  whether  some  tiny
      discontinuity in the slope is due to real nonsmoothness or just  due
      to numerical noise alone.

      Our top priority was to avoid false positives, so in some rare cases
      minor errors may went unnoticed (however, in most cases they can  be
      spotted with restart from different initial point).

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    state   -   algorithm state
    level   -   monitoring level:
                * 0 - monitoring is disabled
                * 1 - noninvasive low-overhead monitoring; function values
                      and/or gradients are recorded, but OptGuard does not
                      try to perform additional evaluations  in  order  to
                      get more information about suspicious locations.

=== EXPLANATION ==========================================================

One major source of headache during optimization  is  the  possibility  of
the coding errors in the target function/constraints (or their gradients).
Such  errors   most   often   manifest   themselves  as  discontinuity  or
nonsmoothness of the target/constraints.

Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something involving
lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth target. Although not  a
coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway - and smooth  optimizers  usually
stop right after encountering nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.

OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations: it monitors
function values/gradients being passed  to  the  optimizer  and  tries  to
errors. Upon discovering suspicious pair of points it  raises  appropriate
flag (and allows you to continue optimization). When optimization is done,
you can study OptGuard result.

This family of functions is used to launcn iterations of nonlinear optimizer

These functions accept following parameters:
    state   -   algorithm state
    func    -   callback which calculates function (or merit function)
                value func at given point x
    grad    -   callback which calculates function (or merit function)
                value func and gradient grad at given point x
    rep     -   optional callback which is called after each iteration
                can be NULL
    ptr     -   optional pointer which is passed to func/grad/hess/jac/rep
                can be NULL

NOTES:

1. This function has two different implementations: one which  uses  exact
   (analytical) user-supplied  gradient, and one which uses function value
   only  and  numerically  differentiates  function  in  order  to  obtain
   gradient.

   Depending  on  the  specific  function  used to create optimizer object
   (either MinCGCreate()  for analytical gradient  or  MinCGCreateF()  for
   numerical differentiation) you should  choose  appropriate  variant  of
   MinCGOptimize() - one which accepts function AND gradient or one  which
   accepts function ONLY.

   Be careful to choose variant of MinCGOptimize()  which  corresponds  to
   your optimization scheme! Table below lists different  combinations  of
   callback (function/gradient) passed  to  MinCGOptimize()  and  specific
   function used to create optimizer.


                  |         USER PASSED TO MinCGOptimize()
   CREATED WITH   |  function only   |  function and gradient
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   MinCGCreateF() |     work                FAIL
   MinCGCreate()  |     FAIL                work

   Here &quot;FAIL&quot; denotes inappropriate combinations  of  optimizer  creation
   function and MinCGOptimize() version. Attemps to use  such  combination
   (for  example,  to create optimizer with  MinCGCreateF()  and  to  pass
   gradient information to MinCGOptimize()) will lead to  exception  being
   thrown. Either  you  did  not  pass  gradient when it WAS needed or you
   passed gradient when it was NOT needed.

This function sets scaling coefficients for CG optimizer.

ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
a) &quot;how large&quot; the variable is
b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of CG optimizer  -  step
along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

In   most   optimizers  (and  in  the  CG  too)  scaling is NOT a form  of
preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
preconditioner by separate call to one of the MinCGSetPrec...() functions.

There  is  special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
forms of tuning solver.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure stores algorithm state
    S       -   array[N], non-zero scaling coefficients

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state
    StpMax  -   maximum step length, &gt;=0. Set StpMax to 0.0,  if you don't
                want to limit step length.

Use this subroutine when you optimize target function which contains exp()
or  other  fast  growing  functions,  and optimization algorithm makes too
large  steps  which  leads  to overflow. This function allows us to reject
steps  that  are  too  large  (and  therefore  expose  us  to the possible
overflow) without actually calculating function value at the x+stp*d.

This function allows to suggest initial step length to the CG algorithm.

Suggested  step  length  is used as starting point for the line search. It
can be useful when you have  badly  scaled  problem,  i.e.  when  ||grad||
(which is used as initial estimate for the first step) is many  orders  of
magnitude different from the desired step.

Line search  may  fail  on  such problems without good estimate of initial
step length. Imagine, for example, problem with ||grad||=10^50 and desired
step equal to 0.1 Line  search function will use 10^50  as  initial  step,
then  it  will  decrease step length by 2 (up to 20 attempts) and will get
10^44, which is still too large.

This function allows us to tell than line search should  be  started  from
some moderate step length, like 1.0, so algorithm will be able  to  detect
desired step length in a several searches.

Default behavior (when no step is suggested) is to use preconditioner,  if
it is available, to generate initial estimate of step length.

This function influences only first iteration of algorithm. It  should  be
called between MinCGCreate/MinCGRestartFrom() call and MinCGOptimize call.
Suggested step is ignored if you have preconditioner.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure used to store algorithm state.
    Stp     -   initial estimate of the step length.
                Can be zero (no estimate).

        LIMITED MEMORY BFGS METHOD FOR LARGE SCALE OPTIMIZATION

DESCRIPTION:
The subroutine minimizes function F(x) of N arguments by  using  a  quasi-
Newton method (LBFGS scheme) which is optimized to use  a  minimum  amount
of memory.
The subroutine generates the approximation of an inverse Hessian matrix by
using information about the last M steps of the algorithm  (instead of N).
It lessens a required amount of memory from a value  of  order  N^2  to  a
value of order 2*N*M.


REQUIREMENTS:
Algorithm will request following information during its operation:
* function value F and its gradient G (simultaneously) at given point X


USAGE:
1. User initializes algorithm state with MinLBFGSCreate() call
2. User tunes solver parameters with MinLBFGSSetCond() MinLBFGSSetStpMax()
   and other functions
3. User calls MinLBFGSOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state and
   pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.
4. User calls MinLBFGSResults() to get solution
5. Optionally user may call MinLBFGSRestartFrom() to solve another problem
   with same N/M but another starting point and/or another function.
   MinLBFGSRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension. N&gt;0
    M       -   number of corrections in the BFGS scheme of Hessian
                approximation update. Recommended value:  3&lt;=M&lt;=7. The smaller
                value causes worse convergence, the bigger will  not  cause  a
                considerably better convergence, but will cause a fall in  the
                performance. M&lt;=N.
    X       -   initial solution approximation, array[0..N-1].


OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state


NOTES:
1. you may tune stopping conditions with MinLBFGSSetCond() function
2. if target function contains exp() or other fast growing functions,  and
   optimization algorithm makes too large steps which leads  to  overflow,
   use MinLBFGSSetStpMax() function to bound algorithm's  steps.  However,
   L-BFGS rarely needs such a tuning.

The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinLBFGSCreate().  It  uses
finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

Description below contains information which is specific to  this function
only. We recommend to read comments on MinLBFGSCreate() in  order  to  get
more information about creation of LBFGS optimizer.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N&gt;0:
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
    M       -   number of corrections in the BFGS scheme of Hessian
                approximation update. Recommended value:  3&lt;=M&lt;=7. The smaller
                value causes worse convergence, the bigger will  not  cause  a
                considerably better convergence, but will cause a fall in  the
                performance. M&lt;=N.
    X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
    DiffStep-   differentiation step, &gt;0

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

NOTES:
1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
   S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinLBFGSSetScale() call.
3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
   large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
   step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
   value to start with.
4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
   calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
   any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
   However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
   small ones.
   We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
   is   less  robust  and  precise.  LBFGS  needs  exact  gradient values.
   Imprecise gradient may slow  down  convergence,  especially  on  highly
   nonlinear problems.
   Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
   dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
   as possible.

<div style='color: green; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;'>/*************************************************************************
This  function  activates/deactivates verification  of  the  user-supplied
analytic gradient.

Upon  activation  of  this  option  OptGuard  integrity  checker  performs
numerical differentiation of your target function  at  the  initial  point
(note: future versions may also perform check  at  the  final  point)  and
compares numerical gradient with analytic one provided by you.

If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization  session
continues. After optimization session is over, you can retrieve the report
which  stores  both  gradients  and  specific  components  highlighted  as
suspicious by the OptGuard.

The primary OptGuard report can be retrieved with minlbfgsoptguardresults().

IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you
           about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases it may
           cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.

           YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT IN THE PRODUCTION CODE UNLESS YOU WANT TO
           CHECK DERIVATIVES PROVIDED BY SOME THIRD PARTY.

NOTE: unlike previous incarnation of the gradient checking code,  OptGuard
      does NOT interrupt optimization even if it discovers bad gradient.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State       -   structure used to store algorithm state
    TestStep    -   verification step used for numerical differentiation:
                    * TestStep=0 turns verification off
                    * TestStep&gt;0 activates verification
                    You should carefully choose TestStep. Value  which  is
                    too large (so large that  function  behavior  is  non-
                    cubic at this scale) will lead  to  false  alarms. Too
                    short step will result in rounding  errors  dominating
                    numerical derivative.

                    You may use different step for different parameters by
                    means of setting scale with minlbfgssetscale().

=== EXPLANATION ==========================================================

In order to verify gradient algorithm performs following steps:
  * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and X[i]+TestStep*S[i],
    where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
    of i-th parameter
  * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
  * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
  * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
    points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
    point

Nonsmoothness (non-C1)  test  #1  studies  individual  components  of  the
gradient computed during line search.

When precise analytic gradient is provided this test is more powerful than
test #0  which  works  with  function  values  and  ignores  user-provided
gradient.  However,  test  #0  becomes  more   powerful   when   numerical
differentiation is employed (in such cases test #1 detects  higher  levels
of numerical noise and becomes too conservative).

This test also tells specific components of the gradient which violate  C1
continuity, which makes it more informative than #0, which just tells that
continuity is violated.

Two reports are returned:
* a &quot;strongest&quot; one, corresponding  to  line   search  which  had  highest
  value of the nonsmoothness indicator
* a &quot;longest&quot; one, corresponding to line search which  had  more  function

In both cases following fields are returned:

* positive - is TRUE  when test flagged suspicious point;  FALSE  if  test
  did not notice anything (in the latter cases fields below are empty).
* vidx - is an index of the variable in [0,N) with nonsmooth derivative

Results of OptGuard integrity check, should be called  after  optimization
session is over.

=== PRIMARY REPORT =======================================================

OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch common errors
in the implementation of nonlinear function/gradient:
* incorrect analytic gradient
* discontinuous (non-C0) target functions (constraints)
* nonsmooth     (non-C1) target functions (constraints)

Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:
* minlbfgsoptguardgradient() for gradient verification
* minlbfgsoptguardsmoothness() for C0/C1 checks

Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
* rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
  * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (gradient element) suspected
  * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient is tested
  * rep.badgraduser, user-provided gradient  (stored  as  2D  matrix  with
    single row in order to make  report  structure  compatible  with  more
    complex optimizers like MinNLC or MinLM)
  * rep.badgradnum,   reference    gradient    obtained    via   numerical
    differentiation (stored as  2D matrix with single row in order to make
    report structure compatible with more complex optimizers  like  MinNLC
    or MinLM)
* rep.nonc0suspected
* rep.nonc1suspected

=== ADDITIONAL REPORTS/LOGS ==============================================

Several different tests are performed to catch C0/C1 errors, you can  find
out specific test signaled error by looking to:
* rep.nonc0test0positive, for non-C0 test #0
* rep.nonc1test0positive, for non-C1 test #0
* rep.nonc1test1positive, for non-C1 test #1

Additional information (including line search logs)  can  be  obtained  by
means of:
* minlbfgsoptguardnonc1test0results()
* minlbfgsoptguardnonc1test1results()
which return detailed error reports, specific points where discontinuities
were found, and so on.

==========================================================================

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    state   -   algorithm state

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    rep     -   generic OptGuard report;  more  detailed  reports  can  be
                retrieved with other functions.

NOTE: false negatives (nonsmooth problems are not identified as  nonsmooth
      ones) are possible although unlikely.

      The reason  is  that  you  need  to  make several evaluations around
      nonsmoothness  in  order  to  accumulate  enough  information  about
      function curvature. Say, if you start right from the nonsmooth point,
      optimizer simply won't get enough data to understand what  is  going
      wrong before it terminates due to abrupt changes in the  derivative.
      It is also  possible  that  &quot;unlucky&quot;  step  will  move  us  to  the
      termination too quickly.

      Our current approach is to have less than 0.1%  false  negatives  in
      our test examples  (measured  with  multiple  restarts  from  random
      points), and to have exactly 0% false positives.

<div style='color: green; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;'>/*************************************************************************
This  function  activates/deactivates nonsmoothness monitoring  option  of
the  OptGuard  integrity  checker. Smoothness  monitor  silently  observes
solution process and tries to detect ill-posed problems, i.e. ones with:
a) discontinuous target function (non-C0)
b) nonsmooth     target function (non-C1)

Smoothness monitoring does NOT interrupt optimization  even if it suspects
that your problem is nonsmooth. It just sets corresponding  flags  in  the
OptGuard report which can be retrieved after optimization is over.

Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often adds  less
than 1% to the optimizer running time. Thus, you can use it even for large
scale problems.

NOTE: OptGuard does  NOT  guarantee  that  it  will  always  detect  C0/C1
      continuity violations.

      First, minor errors are hard to  catch - say, a 0.0001 difference in
      the model values at two sides of the gap may be due to discontinuity
      of the model - or simply because the model has changed.

      Second, C1-violations  are  especially  difficult  to  detect  in  a
      noninvasive way. The optimizer usually  performs  very  short  steps
      near the nonsmoothness, and differentiation  usually   introduces  a
      lot of numerical noise.  It  is  hard  to  tell  whether  some  tiny
      discontinuity in the slope is due to real nonsmoothness or just  due
      to numerical noise alone.

      Our top priority was to avoid false positives, so in some rare cases
      minor errors may went unnoticed (however, in most cases they can  be
      spotted with restart from different initial point).

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    state   -   algorithm state
    level   -   monitoring level:
                * 0 - monitoring is disabled
                * 1 - noninvasive low-overhead monitoring; function values
                      and/or gradients are recorded, but OptGuard does not
                      try to perform additional evaluations  in  order  to
                      get more information about suspicious locations.

=== EXPLANATION ==========================================================

One major source of headache during optimization  is  the  possibility  of
the coding errors in the target function/constraints (or their gradients).
Such  errors   most   often   manifest   themselves  as  discontinuity  or
nonsmoothness of the target/constraints.

Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something involving
lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth target. Although not  a
coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway - and smooth  optimizers  usually
stop right after encountering nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.

OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations: it monitors
function values/gradients being passed  to  the  optimizer  and  tries  to
errors. Upon discovering suspicious pair of points it  raises  appropriate
flag (and allows you to continue optimization). When optimization is done,
you can study OptGuard result.

This family of functions is used to launcn iterations of nonlinear optimizer

These functions accept following parameters:
    state   -   algorithm state
    func    -   callback which calculates function (or merit function)
                value func at given point x
    grad    -   callback which calculates function (or merit function)
                value func and gradient grad at given point x

    ptr     -   optional pointer which is passed to func/grad/hess/jac/rep
                can be NULL

NOTES:

1. This function has two different implementations: one which  uses  exact
   (analytical) user-supplied gradient,  and one which uses function value
   only  and  numerically  differentiates  function  in  order  to  obtain
   gradient.

   Depending  on  the  specific  function  used to create optimizer object
   (either MinLBFGSCreate() for analytical gradient  or  MinLBFGSCreateF()
   for numerical differentiation) you should choose appropriate variant of
   MinLBFGSOptimize() - one  which  accepts  function  AND gradient or one
   which accepts function ONLY.

   Be careful to choose variant of MinLBFGSOptimize() which corresponds to
   your optimization scheme! Table below lists different  combinations  of
   callback (function/gradient) passed to MinLBFGSOptimize()  and specific
   function used to create optimizer.

   Here &quot;FAIL&quot; denotes inappropriate combinations  of  optimizer  creation
   function  and  MinLBFGSOptimize()  version.   Attemps   to   use   such
   combination (for example, to create optimizer with MinLBFGSCreateF() and
   to pass gradient information to MinCGOptimize()) will lead to exception
   being thrown. Either  you  did  not pass gradient when it WAS needed or
   you passed gradient when it was NOT needed.

Modification of the preconditioner: scale-based diagonal preconditioning.

This preconditioning mode can be useful when you  don't  have  approximate

(for  example,  one  variable is in [1,10], and another in [1000,100000]),

In this case simple  scale-based  preconditioner,  with H[i] = 1/(s[i]^2),

IMPRTANT: you should set scale of your variables  with  MinLBFGSSetScale()
call  (before  or after MinLBFGSSetPrecScale() call). Without knowledge of
the scale of your variables scale-based preconditioner will be  just  unit
matrix.

This function sets scaling coefficients for LBFGS optimizer.

ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
a) &quot;how large&quot; the variable is
b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of the optimizer  - step
along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

In  most  optimizers  (and  in  the  LBFGS  too)  scaling is NOT a form of
preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
preconditioner  by  separate  call  to  one  of  the  MinLBFGSSetPrec...()
functions.

There  is  special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
forms of tuning solver.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure stores algorithm state
    S       -   array[N], non-zero scaling coefficients
                S[i] may be negative, sign doesn't matter.

    LEVENBERG-MARQUARDT-LIKE METHOD FOR NON-LINEAR OPTIMIZATION

DESCRIPTION:
This  function  is  used  to  find  minimum  of general form (not &quot;sum-of-
-squares&quot;) function
    F = F(x[0], ..., x[n-1])
using  its  gradient  and  Hessian.  Levenberg-Marquardt modification with
L-BFGS pre-optimization and internal pre-conditioned  L-BFGS  optimization
after each Levenberg-Marquardt step is used.


REQUIREMENTS:
This algorithm will request following information during its operation:

* function value F at given point X
* F and gradient G (simultaneously) at given point X
* F, G and Hessian H (simultaneously) at given point X

There are several overloaded versions of  MinLMOptimize()  function  which
correspond  to  different LM-like optimization algorithms provided by this
unit. You should choose version which accepts func(),  grad()  and  hess()
function pointers. First pointer is used to calculate F  at  given  point,
second  one  calculates  F(x)  and  grad F(x),  third one calculates F(x),
grad F(x), hess F(x).

You can try to initialize MinLMState structure with FGH-function and  then
use incorrect version of MinLMOptimize() (for example, version which  does
not provide Hessian matrix), but it will lead to  exception  being  thrown
after first attempt to calculate Hessian.


USAGE:
1. User initializes algorithm state with MinLMCreateFGH() call
2. User tunes solver parameters with MinLMSetCond(),  MinLMSetStpMax() and
   other functions
3. User calls MinLMOptimize() function which  takes algorithm  state   and
   pointers (delegates, etc.) to callback functions.
4. User calls MinLMResults() to get solution
5. Optionally, user may call MinLMRestartFrom() to solve  another  problem
   with same N but another starting point and/or another function.
   MinLMRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   dimension, N&gt;1
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
    X       -   initial solution, array[0..N-1]

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

NOTES:
1. you may tune stopping conditions with MinLMSetCond() function
2. if target function contains exp() or other fast growing functions,  and
   optimization algorithm makes too large steps which leads  to  overflow,
   use MinLMSetStpMax() function to bound algorithm's steps.

numerical differentiation of your target function vector  at  the  initial
point (note: future versions may also perform check  at  the final  point)
and compares numerical Jacobian with analytic one provided by you.

If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization  session
continues. After optimization session is over, you can retrieve the report
which stores  both  Jacobians,  and  specific  components  highlighted  as
suspicious by the OptGuard.

The OptGuard report can be retrieved with minlmoptguardresults().

IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you
           about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases it may
           cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.

           YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT IN THE PRODUCTION CODE UNLESS YOU WANT TO
           CHECK DERIVATIVES PROVIDED BY SOME THIRD PARTY.

NOTE: unlike previous incarnation of the gradient checking code,  OptGuard
      does NOT interrupt optimization even if it discovers bad gradient.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State       -   structure used to store algorithm state
    TestStep    -   verification step used for numerical differentiation:
                    * TestStep=0 turns verification off
                    * TestStep&gt;0 activates verification
                    You should carefully choose TestStep. Value  which  is
                    too large (so large that  function  behavior  is  non-
                    cubic at this scale) will lead  to  false  alarms. Too
                    short step will result in rounding  errors  dominating
                    numerical derivative.

                    You may use different step for different parameters by
                    means of setting scale with minlmsetscale().

=== EXPLANATION ==========================================================

In order to verify gradient algorithm performs following steps:
  * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and X[i]+TestStep*S[i],
    where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
    of i-th parameter
  * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
  * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
  * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
    points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
    point

Results of OptGuard integrity check, should be called  after  optimization
session is over.

OptGuard checks analytic Jacobian  against  reference  value  obtained  by
numerical differentiation with user-specified step.

NOTE: other optimizers perform additional OptGuard checks for things  like
      C0/C1-continuity violations. However, LM optimizer  can  check  only
      for incorrect Jacobian.

      The reason is that unlike line search methods LM optimizer does  not
      perform extensive evaluations along the line. Thus, we simply do not
      have enough data to catch C0/C1-violations.

This check is activated with  minlmoptguardgradient() function.

Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
* rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
  * rep.badgradfidx for specific function (Jacobian row) suspected
  * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (Jacobian column) suspected
  * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient/Jacobian is tested
  * rep.badgraduser, user-provided gradient/Jacobian
  * rep.badgradnum, reference gradient/Jacobian obtained via numerical
    differentiation

This family of functions is used to launcn iterations of nonlinear optimizer

These functions accept following parameters:
    state   -   algorithm state
    func    -   callback which calculates function (or merit function)
                value func at given point x
    grad    -   callback which calculates function (or merit function)
                value func and gradient grad at given point x

                value func, gradient grad and Hessian hess at given point x
    fvec    -   callback which calculates function vector fi[]
                at given point x
    jac     -   callback which calculates function vector fi[]
                and Jacobian jac at given point x
    rep     -   optional callback which is called after each iteration
                can be NULL
    ptr     -   optional pointer which is passed to func/grad/hess/jac/rep
                can be NULL

NOTES:

1. Depending on function used to create state  structure,  this  algorithm
   may accept Jacobian and/or Hessian and/or gradient.  According  to  the
   said above, there ase several versions of this function,  which  accept
   different sets of callbacks.

   This flexibility opens way to subtle errors - you may create state with
   MinLMCreateFGH() (optimization using Hessian), but call function  which
   does not accept Hessian. So when algorithm will request Hessian,  there
   will be no callback to call. In this case exception will be thrown.

   Be careful to avoid such errors because there is no way to find them at
   compile time - you can see them at runtime only.

This function is used to change acceleration settings

You can choose between three acceleration strategies:
* AccType=0, no acceleration.
* AccType=1, secant updates are used to update quadratic model after  each
  iteration. After fixed number of iterations (or after  model  breakdown)
  we  recalculate  quadratic  model  using  analytic  Jacobian  or  finite
  differences. Number of secant-based iterations depends  on  optimization
  settings: about 3 iterations - when we have analytic Jacobian, up to 2*N
  iterations - when we use finite differences to calculate Jacobian.

AccType=1 is recommended when Jacobian  calculation  cost is prohibitively
high (several Mx1 function vector calculations  followed  by  several  NxN
Cholesky factorizations are faster than calculation of one M*N  Jacobian).
It should also be used when we have no Jacobian, because finite difference
approximation takes too much time to compute.

Table below list  optimization  protocols  (XYZ  protocol  corresponds  to
MinLMCreateXYZ) and acceleration types they support (and use by  default).

ACCELERATION TYPES SUPPORTED BY OPTIMIZATION PROTOCOLS:

                * if CT[i]&lt;0, then I-th constraint is C[i,*]*x &lt;= C[i,n+1]
    K       -   number of equality/inequality constraints, K&gt;=0:
                * if given, only leading K elements of C/CT are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from sizes of C/CT

IMPORTANT: if you have linear constraints, it is strongly  recommended  to
           set scale of variables with minlmsetscale(). QP solver which is
           used to calculate linearly constrained steps heavily relies  on
           good scaling of input problems.

IMPORTANT: solvers created with minlmcreatefgh()  do  not  support  linear
           constraints.

NOTE: linear  (non-bound)  constraints are satisfied only approximately  -
      there  always  exists some violation due  to  numerical  errors  and
      algorithmic limitations.

NOTE: general linear constraints  add  significant  overhead  to  solution
      process. Although solver performs roughly same amount of  iterations
      (when compared  with  similar  box-only  constrained  problem), each
      iteration   now    involves  solution  of  linearly  constrained  QP
      subproblem, which requires ~3-5 times more Cholesky  decompositions.
      Thus, if you can reformulate your problem in such way  this  it  has
      only box constraints, it may be beneficial to do so.

This function sets scaling coefficients for LM optimizer.

ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
a) &quot;how large&quot; the variable is
b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

Generally, scale is NOT considered to be a form of preconditioner.  But LM
optimizer is unique in that it uses scaling matrix both  in  the  stopping
condition tests and as Marquardt damping factor.

Proper scaling is very important for the algorithm performance. It is less
important for the quality of results, but still has some influence (it  is
easier  to  converge  when  variables  are  properly  scaled, so premature
stopping is possible when very badly scalled variables are  combined  with
relaxed stopping conditions).

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure stores algorithm state
    S       -   array[N], non-zero scaling coefficients
                S[i] may be negative, sign doesn't matter.

This function sets maximum step length

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state
    StpMax  -   maximum step length, &gt;=0. Set StpMax to 0.0,  if you don't
                want to limit step length.

Use this subroutine when you optimize target function which contains exp()
or  other  fast  growing  functions,  and optimization algorithm makes too
large  steps  which  leads  to overflow. This function allows us to reject
steps  that  are  too  large  (and  therefore  expose  us  to the possible
overflow) without actually calculating function value at the x+stp*d.

NOTE: non-zero StpMax leads to moderate  performance  degradation  because
intermediate  step  of  preconditioned L-BFGS optimization is incompatible
with limits on step size.

The subroutine creates LP  solver.  After  initial  creation  it  contains
default optimization problem with zero cost vector and all variables being
fixed to zero values and no constraints.

In order to actually solve something you should:
* set cost vector with minlpsetcost()
* set variable bounds with minlpsetbc() or minlpsetbcall()
* specify constraint matrix with one of the following functions:
  [*] minlpsetlc()        for dense one-sided constraints
  [*] minlpsetlc2dense()  for dense two-sided constraints
  [*] minlpsetlc2()       for sparse two-sided constraints
  [*] minlpaddlc2dense()  to add one dense row to constraint matrix
  [*] minlpaddlc2()       to add one row to constraint matrix (compressed format)
* call minlpoptimize() to run the solver and  minlpresults()  to  get  the
  solution vector and additional information.

Presently  this  optimizer  supports  only  revised  simplex   method   as
underlying solver. DSE pricing and bounds flipping ratio  test  (aka  long
dual step) are supported. Large-scale sparse LU solver with  Forest-Tomlin
is used internally as linear algebra driver.

Future releases of ALGLIB may introduce other solvers.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem size

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   optimizer in the default state

This function sets box constraints for LP solver (all variables  at  once,
different constraints for different variables).

The default state of constraints is to have all variables fixed  at  zero.
You have to overwrite it by your own constraint vector. Constraint  status
is preserved until constraints are  explicitly  overwritten  with  another
minlpsetbc()  call,   overwritten   with  minlpsetbcall(),  or   partially
overwritten with minlmsetbci() call.

Following types of constraints are supported:

    DESCRIPTION         CONSTRAINT              HOW TO SPECIFY
    fixed variable      x[i]=Bnd[i]             BndL[i]=BndU[i]
    lower bound         BndL[i]&lt;=x[i]           BndU[i]=+INF
    upper bound         x[i]&lt;=BndU[i]           BndL[i]=-INF
    range               BndL[i]&lt;=x[i]&lt;=BndU[i]  ...
    free variable       -                       BndL[I]=-INF, BndU[I]+INF

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure stores algorithm state
    BndL    -   lower bounds, array[N].
    BndU    -   upper bounds, array[N].

NOTE: infinite values can be specified by means of Double.PositiveInfinity
      and  Double.NegativeInfinity  (in  C#)  and  alglib::fp_posinf   and
      alglib::fp_neginf (in C++).

NOTE: you may replace infinities by very small/very large values,  but  it
      is not recommended because large numbers may introduce large numerical
      errors in the algorithm.

NOTE: if constraints for all variables are same you may use minlpsetbcall()
      which allows to specify constraints without using arrays.

                  NONLINEARLY  CONSTRAINED  OPTIMIZATION
            WITH PRECONDITIONED AUGMENTED LAGRANGIAN ALGORITHM

DESCRIPTION:
The  subroutine  minimizes  function   F(x)  of N arguments subject to any
combination of:
* bound constraints
* linear inequality constraints
* linear equality constraints
* nonlinear equality constraints Gi(x)=0
* nonlinear inequality constraints Hi(x)&lt;=0

REQUIREMENTS:
* user must provide function value and gradient for F(), H(), G()
* starting point X0 must be feasible or not too far away from the feasible
  set
* F(), G(), H() are continuously differentiable on the  feasible  set  and
  its neighborhood
* nonlinear constraints G() and H() must have non-zero gradient at  G(x)=0
  and at H(x)=0. Say, constraint like x^2&gt;=1 is supported, but x^2&gt;=0   is
  NOT supported.

USAGE:

Constrained optimization if far more complex than the  unconstrained  one.
Nonlinearly constrained optimization is one of the most esoteric numerical
procedures.

Here we give very brief outline  of  the  MinNLC  optimizer.  We  strongly
recommend you to study examples in the ALGLIB Reference Manual and to read
ALGLIB User Guide on optimization, which is available at
http://www.alglib.net/optimization/

1. User initializes algorithm state with MinNLCCreate() call  and  chooses
   what NLC solver to use. There is some solver which is used by  default,
   with default settings, but you should NOT rely on  default  choice.  It
   may change in future releases of ALGLIB without notice, and no one  can
   guarantee that new solver will be  able  to  solve  your  problem  with
   default settings.

   From the other side, if you choose solver explicitly, you can be pretty
   sure that it will work with new ALGLIB releases.

   In the current release following solvers can be used:
   * SQP solver, recommended for medium-scale problems (less than thousand
     of variables) with hard-to-evaluate target functions.  Requires  less
     function  evaluations  than  other  solvers  but  each  step involves
     solution of QP subproblem, so running time may be higher than that of
     AUL (another recommended option). Activated  with  minnlcsetalgosqp()
     function.
   * AUL solver with dense  preconditioner,  recommended  for  large-scale
     problems or for problems  with  cheap  target  function.  Needs  more
     function evaluations that SQP (about  5x-10x  times  more),  but  its
     iterations  are  much  cheaper  that  that  of  SQP.  Activated  with
     minnlcsetalgoaul() function.
   * SLP solver, successive linear programming. The slowest one,  requires
     more target function evaluations that SQP and  AUL.  However,  it  is
     somewhat more robust in tricky cases, so it can be used  as  a backup
     plan. Activated with minnlcsetalgoslp() function.

2. [optional] user activates OptGuard  integrity checker  which  tries  to
   detect possible errors in the user-supplied callbacks:
   * discontinuity/nonsmoothness of the target/nonlinear constraints
   * errors in the analytic gradient provided by user
   This feature is essential for early prototyping stages because it helps
   to catch common coding and problem statement errors.
   OptGuard can be activated with following functions (one per each  check
   performed):
   * minnlcoptguardsmoothness()
   * minnlcoptguardgradient()

3. User adds boundary and/or linear and/or nonlinear constraints by  means
   of calling one of the following functions:
   a) minnlcsetbc() for boundary constraints
   b) minnlcsetlc() for linear constraints
   c) minnlcsetnlc() for nonlinear constraints
   You may combine (a), (b) and (c) in one optimization problem.

4. User sets scale of the variables with minnlcsetscale() function. It  is
   VERY important to set  scale  of  the  variables,  because  nonlinearly
   constrained problems are hard to solve when variables are badly scaled.

5. User sets  stopping  conditions  with  minnlcsetcond(). If  NLC  solver
   uses  inner/outer  iteration  layout,  this  function   sets   stopping
   conditions for INNER iterations.

6. Finally, user calls minnlcoptimize()  function  which  takes  algorithm
   state and pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates
   F/G/H.

7. User calls  minnlcresults()  to  get  solution;  additionally  you  can
   retrieve OptGuard report with minnlcoptguardresults(), and get detailed
   report about purported errors in the target function with:
   * minnlcoptguardnonc1test0results()
   * minnlcoptguardnonc1test1results()

8. Optionally user may call minnlcrestartfrom() to solve  another  problem
   with same N but another starting point. minnlcrestartfrom()  allows  to
   reuse already initialized structure.

    N       -   problem dimension, N&gt;0:

This subroutine is a finite  difference variant of MinNLCCreate(). It uses
finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

Description below contains information which is specific to this  function
only. We recommend to read comments on MinNLCCreate() in order to get more
information about creation of NLC optimizer.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N&gt;0:
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size ofX

                * it is better to set X to a feasible point
                * but X can be infeasible, in which case algorithm will try
                  to find feasible point first, using X as initial
                  approximation.
    DiffStep-   differentiation step, &gt;0

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure stores algorithm state

NOTES:
1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
   S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinNLCSetScale() call.
3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
   large step will result in too large TRUNCATION  errors, while too small
   step will result in too large NUMERICAL  errors.  1.0E-4  can  be  good
   value to start from.
4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
   calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
   any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
   However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
   small ones.
   We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
   is  less   robust   and  precise.  Imprecise  gradient  may  slow  down
   convergence, especially on highly nonlinear problems.
   Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
   dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
   as possible.

This  function  activates/deactivates verification  of  the  user-supplied
analytic gradient/Jacobian.

Upon  activation  of  this  option  OptGuard  integrity  checker  performs
numerical differentiation of your target  function  (constraints)  at  the
initial point (note: future versions may also perform check  at  the final
point) and compares numerical gradient/Jacobian with analytic one provided
by you.

If difference is too large, an error flag is set and optimization  session
continues. After optimization session is over, you can retrieve the report
which stores both gradients/Jacobians, and specific components highlighted
as suspicious by the OptGuard.

The primary OptGuard report can be retrieved with minnlcoptguardresults().

IMPORTANT: gradient check is a high-overhead option which  will  cost  you
           about 3*N additional function evaluations. In many cases it may
           cost as much as the rest of the optimization session.

           YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT IN THE PRODUCTION CODE UNLESS YOU WANT TO
           CHECK DERIVATIVES PROVIDED BY SOME THIRD PARTY.

NOTE: unlike previous incarnation of the gradient checking code,  OptGuard
      does NOT interrupt optimization even if it discovers bad gradient.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State       -   structure used to store algorithm state
    TestStep    -   verification step used for numerical differentiation:
                    * TestStep=0 turns verification off
                    * TestStep&gt;0 activates verification
                    You should carefully choose TestStep. Value  which  is
                    too large (so large that  function  behavior  is  non-
                    cubic at this scale) will lead  to  false  alarms. Too
                    short step will result in rounding  errors  dominating
                    numerical derivative.

                    You may use different step for different parameters by
                    means of setting scale with minnlcsetscale().

=== EXPLANATION ==========================================================

In order to verify gradient algorithm performs following steps:
  * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and X[i]+TestStep*S[i],
    where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
    of i-th parameter
  * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
  * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
  * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
    points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
    point

Nonsmoothness (non-C1) test #0 studies  function  values  (not  gradient!)
obtained during line searches and monitors  behavior  of  the  directional
derivative estimate.

This test is less powerful than test #1, but it does  not  depend  on  the
gradient values and thus it is more robust against artifacts introduced by
numerical differentiation.

Two reports are returned:
* a &quot;strongest&quot; one, corresponding  to  line   search  which  had  highest
  value of the nonsmoothness indicator
* a &quot;longest&quot; one, corresponding to line search which  had  more  function
  evaluations, and thus is more detailed

In both cases following fields are returned:

* positive - is TRUE  when test flagged suspicious point;  FALSE  if  test
  did not notice anything (in the latter cases fields below are empty).
* fidx - is an index of the function (0 for  target  function, 1 or higher
  for nonlinear constraints) which is suspected of being &quot;non-C1&quot;
* x0[], d[] - arrays of length N which store initial point  and  direction
  for line search (d[] can be normalized, but does not have to)
* stp[], f[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths and  function
  values at these points; f[i] is evaluated in x0+stp[i]*d.
* stpidxa, stpidxb - we  suspect  that  function  violates  C1  continuity
  between steps #stpidxa and #stpidxb (usually we have  stpidxb=stpidxa+3,
  with  most  likely  position  of  the  violation  between  stpidxa+1 and

Nonsmoothness (non-C1)  test  #1  studies  individual  components  of  the
gradient computed during line search.

When precise analytic gradient is provided this test is more powerful than
test #0  which  works  with  function  values  and  ignores  user-provided
gradient.  However,  test  #0  becomes  more   powerful   when   numerical
differentiation is employed (in such cases test #1 detects  higher  levels
of numerical noise and becomes too conservative).

This test also tells specific components of the gradient which violate  C1
continuity, which makes it more informative than #0, which just tells that
continuity is violated.

In both cases following fields are returned:

* positive - is TRUE  when test flagged suspicious point;  FALSE  if  test
  did not notice anything (in the latter cases fields below are empty).
* fidx - is an index of the function (0 for  target  function, 1 or higher
  for nonlinear constraints) which is suspected of being &quot;non-C1&quot;
* vidx - is an index of the variable in [0,N) with nonsmooth derivative
* x0[], d[] - arrays of length N which store initial point  and  direction
  for line search (d[] can be normalized, but does not have to)
* stp[], g[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths and  gradient
  values at these points; g[i] is evaluated in  x0+stp[i]*d  and  contains
  vidx-th component of the gradient.
* stpidxa, stpidxb - we  suspect  that  function  violates  C1  continuity

Results of OptGuard integrity check, should be called  after  optimization
session is over.

=== PRIMARY REPORT =======================================================

OptGuard performs several checks which are intended to catch common errors
in the implementation of nonlinear function/gradient:
* incorrect analytic gradient
* discontinuous (non-C0) target functions (constraints)
* nonsmooth     (non-C1) target functions (constraints)

Each of these checks is activated with appropriate function:
* minnlcoptguardgradient() for gradient verification
* minnlcoptguardsmoothness() for C0/C1 checks

Following flags are set when these errors are suspected:
* rep.badgradsuspected, and additionally:
  * rep.badgradfidx for specific function (Jacobian row) suspected
  * rep.badgradvidx for specific variable (Jacobian column) suspected
  * rep.badgradxbase, a point where gradient/Jacobian is tested
  * rep.badgraduser, user-provided gradient/Jacobian
  * rep.badgradnum, reference gradient/Jacobian obtained via numerical
    differentiation
* rep.nonc0suspected, and additionally:
  * rep.nonc0fidx - an index of specific function violating C0 continuity
* rep.nonc1suspected, and additionally
  * rep.nonc1fidx - an index of specific function violating C1 continuity
Here function index 0 means  target function, index 1  or  higher  denotes
nonlinear constraints.

=== ADDITIONAL REPORTS/LOGS ==============================================

Several different tests are performed to catch C0/C1 errors, you can  find
out specific test signaled error by looking to:
* rep.nonc0test0positive, for non-C0 test #0
* rep.nonc1test0positive, for non-C1 test #0
* rep.nonc1test1positive, for non-C1 test #1

Additional information (including line search logs)  can  be  obtained  by
means of:
* minnlcoptguardnonc1test0results()
* minnlcoptguardnonc1test1results()
which return detailed error reports, specific points where discontinuities
were found, and so on.

==========================================================================

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    state   -   algorithm state

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    rep     -   generic OptGuard report;  more  detailed  reports  can  be
                retrieved with other functions.

NOTE: false negatives (nonsmooth problems are not identified as  nonsmooth
      ones) are possible although unlikely.

      The reason  is  that  you  need  to  make several evaluations around
      nonsmoothness  in  order  to  accumulate  enough  information  about
      function curvature. Say, if you start right from the nonsmooth point,
      optimizer simply won't get enough data to understand what  is  going
      wrong before it terminates due to abrupt changes in the  derivative.
      It is also  possible  that  &quot;unlucky&quot;  step  will  move  us  to  the
      termination too quickly.

      Our current approach is to have less than 0.1%  false  negatives  in
      our test examples  (measured  with  multiple  restarts  from  random
      points), and to have exactly 0% false positives.

This  function  activates/deactivates nonsmoothness monitoring  option  of
the  OptGuard  integrity  checker. Smoothness  monitor  silently  observes
solution process and tries to detect ill-posed problems, i.e. ones with:
a) discontinuous target function (non-C0) and/or constraints
b) nonsmooth     target function (non-C1) and/or constraints

Smoothness monitoring does NOT interrupt optimization  even if it suspects
that your problem is nonsmooth. It just sets corresponding  flags  in  the
OptGuard report which can be retrieved after optimization is over.

Smoothness monitoring is a moderate overhead option which often adds  less
than 1% to the optimizer running time. Thus, you can use it even for large
scale problems.

NOTE: OptGuard does  NOT  guarantee  that  it  will  always  detect  C0/C1
      continuity violations.

      First, minor errors are hard to  catch - say, a 0.0001 difference in
      the model values at two sides of the gap may be due to discontinuity
      of the model - or simply because the model has changed.

      Second, C1-violations  are  especially  difficult  to  detect  in  a
      noninvasive way. The optimizer usually  performs  very  short  steps
      near the nonsmoothness, and differentiation  usually   introduces  a
      lot of numerical noise.  It  is  hard  to  tell  whether  some  tiny
      discontinuity in the slope is due to real nonsmoothness or just  due
      to numerical noise alone.

      Our top priority was to avoid false positives, so in some rare cases
      minor errors may went unnoticed (however, in most cases they can  be
      spotted with restart from different initial point).

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    state   -   algorithm state
    level   -   monitoring level:
                * 0 - monitoring is disabled
                * 1 - noninvasive low-overhead monitoring; function values
                      and/or gradients are recorded, but OptGuard does not
                      try to perform additional evaluations  in  order  to
                      get more information about suspicious locations.
                      This kind of monitoring does not work well with  SQP
                      because SQP solver needs just 1-2 function evaluations
                      per step, which is not enough for OptGuard  to  make
                      any conclusions.

=== EXPLANATION ==========================================================

One major source of headache during optimization  is  the  possibility  of
the coding errors in the target function/constraints (or their gradients).
Such  errors   most   often   manifest   themselves  as  discontinuity  or
nonsmoothness of the target/constraints.

Another frequent situation is when you try to optimize something involving
lots of min() and max() operations, i.e. nonsmooth target. Although not  a
coding error, it is nonsmoothness anyway - and smooth  optimizers  usually
stop right after encountering nonsmoothness, well before reaching solution.

OptGuard integrity checker helps you to catch such situations: it monitors
function values/gradients being passed  to  the  optimizer  and  tries  to
errors. Upon discovering suspicious pair of points it  raises  appropriate
flag (and allows you to continue optimization). When optimization is done,
you can study OptGuard result.

This  function  tells MinNLC unit to use  Augmented  Lagrangian  algorithm
for nonlinearly constrained  optimization.  This  algorithm  is  a  slight
modification of one described in &quot;A Modified Barrier-Augmented  Lagrangian
Method for  Constrained  Minimization  (1999)&quot;  by  D.GOLDFARB,  R.POLYAK,
K. SCHEINBERG, I.YUZEFOVICH.

AUL solver can be significantly faster than SQP on easy  problems  due  to
cheaper iterations, although it needs more function evaluations.

Augmented Lagrangian algorithm works by converting problem  of  minimizing
F(x) subject to equality/inequality constraints   to unconstrained problem
of the form

    min[ f(x) +
        + Rho*PENALTY_EQ(x)   + SHIFT_EQ(x,Nu1) +
        + Rho*PENALTY_INEQ(x) + SHIFT_INEQ(x,Nu2) ]

where:
* Rho is a fixed penalization coefficient
* PENALTY_EQ(x) is a penalty term, which is used to APPROXIMATELY  enforce
  equality constraints
* SHIFT_EQ(x) is a special &quot;shift&quot;  term  which  is  used  to  &quot;fine-tune&quot;
  equality constraints, greatly increasing precision
* PENALTY_INEQ(x) is a penalty term which is used to approximately enforce
  inequality constraints
* SHIFT_INEQ(x) is a special &quot;shift&quot;  term  which  is  used to &quot;fine-tune&quot;
  inequality constraints, greatly increasing precision
* Nu1/Nu2 are vectors of Lagrange coefficients which are fine-tuned during
  outer iterations of algorithm

This  version  of  AUL  algorithm  uses   preconditioner,  which   greatly
accelerates convergence. Because this  algorithm  is  similar  to  penalty
methods,  it  may  perform  steps  into  infeasible  area.  All  kinds  of
constraints (boundary, linear and nonlinear ones) may   be   violated   in
intermediate points - and in the solution.  However,  properly  configured
AUL method is significantly better at handling  constraints  than  barrier
and/or penalty methods.

The very basic outline of algorithm is given below:
1) first outer iteration is performed with &quot;default&quot;  values  of  Lagrange
   multipliers Nu1/Nu2. Solution quality is low (candidate  point  can  be
   too  far  away  from  true  solution; large violation of constraints is
   possible) and is comparable with that of penalty methods.
2) subsequent outer iterations  refine  Lagrange  multipliers  and improve
   quality of the solution.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state
    Rho     -   penalty coefficient, Rho&gt;0:
                * large enough  that  algorithm  converges  with   desired
                  precision. Minimum value is 10*max(S'*diag(H)*S),  where
                  S is a scale matrix (set by MinNLCSetScale) and H  is  a
                  Hessian of the function being minimized. If you can  not
                  easily estimate Hessian norm,  see  our  recommendations

                  magnitude), Rho=100 or Rho=1000 can be used.
                * it is important to note that Rho is internally multiplied
                  by scaling matrix, i.e. optimum value of Rho depends  on
                  scale of variables specified  by  MinNLCSetScale().
    ItsCnt  -   number of outer iterations:
                * ItsCnt=0 means that small number of outer iterations  is
                  automatically chosen (10 iterations in current version).
                * ItsCnt=1 means that AUL algorithm performs just as usual
                  barrier method.
                * ItsCnt&gt;1 means that  AUL  algorithm  performs  specified
                  number of outer iterations

HOW TO CHOOSE PARAMETERS

Nonlinear optimization is a tricky area and Augmented Lagrangian algorithm
is sometimes hard to tune. Good values of  Rho  and  ItsCnt  are  problem-
specific.  In  order  to  help  you   we   prepared   following   set   of
recommendations:

* for  unit-scale  problems  (variables  and Hessian have unit magnitude),
  Rho=100 or Rho=1000 can be used.

* start from  some  small  value of Rho and solve problem  with  just  one
  outer iteration (ItcCnt=1). In this case algorithm behaves like  penalty
  method. Increase Rho in 2x or 10x steps until you  see  that  one  outer
  iteration returns point which is &quot;rough approximation to solution&quot;.

  It is very important to have Rho so  large  that  penalty  term  becomes
  constraining i.e. modified function becomes highly convex in constrained
  directions.

  From the other side, too large Rho may prevent you  from  converging  to
  the solution. You can diagnose it by studying number of inner iterations
  performed by algorithm: too few (5-10 on  1000-dimensional  problem)  or
  too many (orders of magnitude more than  dimensionality)  usually  means
  that Rho is too large.

* with just one outer iteration you  usually  have  low-quality  solution.
  Some constraints can be violated with very  large  margin,  while  other
  ones (which are NOT violated in the true solution) can push final  point
  too far in the inner area of the feasible set.

  For example, if you have constraint x0&gt;=0 and true solution  x0=1,  then
  merely a presence of &quot;x0&gt;=0&quot; will introduce a bias towards larger values
  of x0. Say, algorithm may stop at x0=1.5 instead of 1.0.

* after you found good Rho, you may increase number of  outer  iterations.
  ItsCnt=10 is a good value. Subsequent outer iteration will refine values
  of  Lagrange  multipliers.  Constraints  which  were  violated  will  be
  enforced, inactive constraints will be dropped (corresponding multipliers
  will be decreased). Ideally, you  should  see  10-1000x  improvement  in
  constraint handling (constraint violation is reduced).

* if  you  see  that  algorithm  converges  to  vicinity  of solution, but
  additional outer iterations do not refine solution,  it  may  mean  that
  algorithm is unstable - it wanders around true  solution,  but  can  not
  approach it. Sometimes algorithm may be stabilized by increasing Rho one
  more time, making it 5x or 10x larger.

SCALING OF CONSTRAINTS [IMPORTANT]

AUL optimizer scales   variables   according   to   scale   specified   by
MinNLCSetScale() function, so it can handle  problems  with  badly  scaled
variables (as long as we KNOW their scales).   However,  because  function
being optimized is a mix  of  original  function and  constraint-dependent
penalty  functions, it  is   important  to   rescale  both  variables  AND
constraints.

Say,  if  you  minimize f(x)=x^2 subject to 1000000*x&gt;=0,  then  you  have
constraint whose scale is different from that of target  function (another
example is 0.000001*x&gt;=0). It is also possible to have constraints   whose
scales  are   misaligned:   1000000*x0&gt;=0, 0.000001*x1&lt;=0.   Inappropriate
scaling may ruin convergence because minimizing x^2 subject to x&gt;=0 is NOT
same as minimizing it subject to 1000000*x&gt;=0.

Because we  know  coefficients  of  boundary/linear  constraints,  we  can
automatically rescale and normalize them. However,  there  is  no  way  to
automatically rescale nonlinear constraints Gi(x) and  Hi(x)  -  they  are
black boxes.

It means that YOU are the one who is  responsible  for  correct scaling of
nonlinear constraints  Gi(x)  and  Hi(x).  We  recommend  you  to  rescale
nonlinear constraints in such way that I-th component of dG/dX (or  dH/dx)
has magnitude approximately equal to 1/S[i] (where S  is  a  scale  set by
MinNLCSetScale() function).

WHAT IF IT DOES NOT CONVERGE?

It is possible that AUL algorithm fails to converge to precise  values  of
Lagrange multipliers. It stops somewhere around true solution, but candidate
point is still too far from solution, and some constraints  are  violated.
Such kind of failure is specific for Lagrangian algorithms -  technically,
they stop at some point, but this point is not constrained solution.

There are exist several reasons why algorithm may fail to converge:
a) too loose stopping criteria for inner iteration
b) degenerate, redundant constraints
c) target function has unconstrained extremum exactly at the  boundary  of
   some constraint
d) numerical noise in the target function

In all these cases algorithm is unstable - each outer iteration results in
large and almost random step which improves handling of some  constraints,
but violates other ones (ideally  outer iterations should form a  sequence
of progressively decreasing steps towards solution).

First reason possible is  that  too  loose  stopping  criteria  for  inner
iteration were specified. Augmented Lagrangian algorithm solves a sequence
of intermediate problems, and requries each of them to be solved with high
precision. Insufficient precision results in incorrect update of  Lagrange
multipliers.

Another reason is that you may have specified degenerate constraints: say,
some constraint was repeated twice. In most cases AUL algorithm gracefully
handles such situations, but sometimes it may spend too much time figuring
out subtle degeneracies in constraint matrix.

Third reason is tricky and hard to diagnose. Consider situation  when  you
minimize  f=x^2  subject to constraint x&gt;=0.  Unconstrained   extremum  is
located  exactly  at  the  boundary  of  constrained  area.  In  this case
algorithm will tend to oscillate between negative  and  positive  x.  Each
time it stops at x&lt;0 it &quot;reinforces&quot; constraint x&gt;=0, and each time it  is
bounced to x&gt;0 it &quot;relaxes&quot; constraint (and is  attracted  to  x&lt;0).

Such situation  sometimes  happens  in  problems  with  hidden  symetries.
Algorithm  is  got  caught  in  a  loop with  Lagrange  multipliers  being
continuously increased/decreased. Luckily, such loop forms after at  least
three iterations, so this problem can be solved by  DECREASING  number  of
outer iterations down to 1-2 and increasing  penalty  coefficient  Rho  as
much as possible.

Final reason is numerical noise. AUL algorithm is robust against  moderate
noise (more robust than, say, active set methods),  but  large  noise  may
destabilize algorithm.

This   function  tells  MinNLC  optimizer  to  use  SLP (Successive Linear
Programming) algorithm for  nonlinearly  constrained   optimization.  This
algorithm  is  a  slight  modification  of  one  described  in  &quot;A  Linear
programming-based optimization algorithm for solving nonlinear programming
problems&quot; (2010) by Claus Still and Tapio Westerlund.

This solver is the slowest one in ALGLIB, it requires more target function
evaluations that SQP and AUL. However it is somewhat more robust in tricky
cases, so it can be used as a backup plan. We recommend to use  this  algo
when SQP/AUL do not work (does not return  the  solution  you  expect). If
trying different approach gives same  results,  then  MAYBE  something  is
wrong with your optimization problem.

Despite its name (&quot;linear&quot; = &quot;first order method&quot;) this algorithm performs
steps similar to that of conjugate gradients method;  internally  it  uses
orthogonality/conjugacy requirement for subsequent steps  which  makes  it
closer to second order methods in terms of convergence speed.

Convergence is proved for the following case:
* function and constraints are continuously differentiable (C1 class)
* extended Mangasarian–Fromovitz constraint qualification  (EMFCQ)  holds;
  in the context of this algorithm EMFCQ  means  that  one  can,  for  any
  infeasible  point,  find  a  search  direction  such that the constraint
  infeasibilities are reduced.

This algorithm has following nice properties:
* no parameters to tune
* no convexity requirements for target function or constraints
* initial point can be infeasible
* algorithm respects box constraints in all intermediate points  (it  does
  not even evaluate function outside of box constrained area)
* once linear constraints are enforced, algorithm will not violate them
* no such guarantees can be provided for nonlinear constraints,  but  once
  nonlinear constraints are enforced, algorithm will try  to  respect them
  as much as possible
* numerical differentiation does not  violate  box  constraints  (although
  general linear and nonlinear ones can be violated during differentiation)
* from our experience, this algorithm is somewhat more  robust  in  really
  difficult cases

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

===== TRACING SLP SOLVER =================================================

SLP solver supports advanced tracing capabilities. You can trace algorithm
output by specifying following trace symbols (case-insensitive)  by  means
of trace_file() call:
* 'SLP'         - for basic trace of algorithm  steps and decisions.  Only
                  short scalars (function values and deltas) are  printed.
                  N-dimensional quantities like search directions are  NOT
                  printed.
                  It also prints OptGuard  integrity  checker  report when
                  nonsmoothness of target/constraints is suspected.
* 'SLP.DETAILED'- for output of points being visited and search directions
                  This  symbol  also  implicitly  defines  'SLP'. You  can
                  control output format by additionally specifying:
                  * nothing     to output in  6-digit exponential format
                  * 'PREC.E15'  to output in 15-digit exponential format
                  * 'PREC.F6'   to output in  6-digit fixed-point format
* 'SLP.PROBING' - to let algorithm insert additional function  evaluations
                  before line search  in  order  to  build  human-readable
                  chart of the raw  Lagrangian  (~40  additional  function
                  evaluations is performed for  each  line  search).  This
                  symbol also implicitly defines 'SLP'.
* 'OPTGUARD'    - for report of smoothness/continuity violations in target
                  and/or constraints. This kind of reporting is   included
                  in 'SLP', but it comes with lots of additional info.  If
                  you  need  just  smoothness  monitoring,   specify  this
                  setting.

                  NOTE: this tag merely directs  OptGuard  output  to  log
                        file. Even if you specify it, you  still  have  to
                        configure OptGuard  by calling minnlcoptguard...()
                        family of functions.

By default trace is disabled and adds  no  overhead  to  the  optimization
process. However, specifying any of the symbols adds some  formatting  and
output-related   overhead.  Specifying  'SLP.PROBING'  adds   even  larger
overhead due to additional function evaluations being performed.

You may specify multiple symbols by separating them with commas:
&gt;

This   function  tells  MinNLC  optimizer to use SQP (Successive Quadratic
Programming) algorithm for nonlinearly constrained optimization.

This algorithm needs order of magnitude (5x-10x) less function evaluations
than AUL solver, but has higher overhead because each  iteration  involves
solution of quadratic programming problem.

Convergence is proved for the following case:
* function and constraints are continuously differentiable (C1 class)

AUL solver can be better option.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

===== INTERACTION WITH OPTGUARD ==========================================

OptGuard integrity  checker  allows us to catch problems  like  errors  in
gradients   and  discontinuity/nonsmoothness  of  the  target/constraints.
Latter kind of problems can be detected  by  looking  upon  line  searches
performed during optimization and searching for signs of nonsmoothness.

The problem with SQP is that it is too good for OptGuard to work - it does
not perform line searches. It typically  needs  1-2  function  evaluations
per step, and it is not enough for OptGuard to detect nonsmoothness.

So, if you suspect that your problem is nonsmooth, we recommend you to use
AUL or SLP solvers.

===== TRACING SQP SOLVER =================================================

SQP solver supports advanced tracing capabilities. You can trace algorithm
output by specifying following trace symbols (case-insensitive)  by  means
of trace_file() call:
* 'SQP'         - for basic trace of algorithm  steps and decisions.  Only
                  short scalars (function values and deltas) are  printed.
                  N-dimensional quantities like search directions are  NOT
                  printed.
                  It also prints OptGuard  integrity  checker  report when
                  nonsmoothness of target/constraints is suspected.
* 'SQP.DETAILED'- for output of points being visited and search directions
                  This  symbol  also  implicitly  defines  'SQP'. You  can
                  control output format by additionally specifying:
                  * nothing     to output in  6-digit exponential format
                  * 'PREC.E15'  to output in 15-digit exponential format
                  * 'PREC.F6'   to output in  6-digit fixed-point format
* 'SQP.PROBING' - to let algorithm insert additional function  evaluations
                  before line search  in  order  to  build  human-readable
                  chart of the raw  Lagrangian  (~40  additional  function

This function sets nonlinear constraints for MinNLC optimizer.

In fact, this function sets NUMBER of nonlinear  constraints.  Constraints
itself (constraint functions) are passed to MinNLCOptimize() method.  This
method requires user-defined vector function F[]  and  its  Jacobian  J[],
where:
* first component of F[] and first row  of  Jacobian  J[]  corresponds  to
  function being minimized
* next NLEC components of F[] (and rows  of  J)  correspond  to  nonlinear
  equality constraints G_i(x)=0
* next NLIC components of F[] (and rows  of  J)  correspond  to  nonlinear
  inequality constraints H_i(x)&lt;=0

NOTE: you may combine nonlinear constraints with linear/boundary ones.  If
      your problem has mixed constraints, you  may explicitly specify some
      of them as linear ones. It may help optimizer to  handle  them  more
      efficiently.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure previously allocated with MinNLCCreate call.
    NLEC    -   number of Non-Linear Equality Constraints (NLEC), &gt;=0
    NLIC    -   number of Non-Linear Inquality Constraints (NLIC), &gt;=0

NOTE 1: when you solve your problem  with  augmented  Lagrangian   solver,
        nonlinear constraints are satisfied only  approximately!   It   is
        possible   that  algorithm  will  evaluate  function  outside   of
        feasible area!

NOTE 2: algorithm scales variables  according  to   scale   specified   by
        MinNLCSetScale()  function,  so  it can handle problems with badly
        scaled variables (as long as we KNOW their scales).

        However,  there  is  no  way  to  automatically  scale   nonlinear
        constraints Gi(x) and Hi(x). Inappropriate scaling  of  Gi/Hi  may
        ruin convergence. Solving problem with  constraint  &quot;1000*G0(x)=0&quot;
        is NOT same as solving it with constraint &quot;0.001*G0(x)=0&quot;.

        It  means  that  YOU  are  the  one who is responsible for correct
        scaling of nonlinear constraints Gi(x) and Hi(x). We recommend you
        to scale nonlinear constraints in such way that I-th component  of
        dG/dX (or dH/dx) has approximately unit  magnitude  (for  problems
        with unit scale)  or  has  magnitude approximately equal to 1/S[i]
        (where S is a scale set by MinNLCSetScale() function).

This function sets preconditioner to &quot;exact low rank&quot; mode.

Preconditioning is very important for convergence of  Augmented Lagrangian
algorithm because presence of penalty term makes problem  ill-conditioned.
Difference between  performance  of  preconditioned  and  unpreconditioned
methods can be as large as 100x!

MinNLC optimizer may use following preconditioners,  each  with   its  own
benefits and drawbacks:
    a) inexact LBFGS-based, with O(N*K) evaluation time
    b) exact low rank one,  with O(N*K^2) evaluation time
    c) exact robust one,    with O(N^3+K*N^2) evaluation time
where K is a total number of general linear and nonlinear constraints (box
ones are not counted).

It also provides special unpreconditioned mode of operation which  can  be
used for test purposes. Comments below discuss low rank preconditioner.

Exact low-rank preconditioner  uses  Woodbury  matrix  identity  to  build
quadratic model of the penalized function. It has following features:
* no special assumptions about orthogonality of constraints
* preconditioner evaluation is optimized for K&lt;&lt;N. Its cost  is  O(N*K^2),
  so it may become prohibitively slow for K&gt;=N.
* finally, stability of the process is guaranteed only for K&lt;&lt;N.  Woodbury
  update often fail for K&gt;=N due to degeneracy of  intermediate  matrices.
  That's why we recommend to use &quot;exact robust&quot;  preconditioner  for  such
  cases.

RECOMMENDATIONS

We  recommend  to  choose  between  &quot;exact  low  rank&quot;  and &quot;exact robust&quot;
preconditioners, with &quot;low rank&quot; version being chosen  when  you  know  in
advance that total count of non-box constraints won't exceed N, and &quot;robust&quot;
version being chosen when you need bulletproof solution.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure stores algorithm state
    UpdateFreq- update frequency. Preconditioner is  rebuilt  after  every
                UpdateFreq iterations. Recommended value: 10 or higher.
                Zero value means that good default value will be used.

It also provides special unpreconditioned mode of operation which  can  be

Exact  robust  preconditioner   uses   Cholesky  decomposition  to  invert
approximate Hessian matrix H=D+W'*C*W (where D stands for  diagonal  terms
of Hessian, combined result of initial scaling matrix and penalty from box
constraints; W stands for general linear constraints and linearization  of
nonlinear ones; C stands for diagonal matrix of penalty coefficients).

This preconditioner has following features:
* no special assumptions about constraint structure
* preconditioner is optimized  for  stability;  unlike  &quot;exact  low  rank&quot;
  version which fails for K&gt;=N, this one works well for any value of K.
* the only drawback is that is takes O(N^3+K*N^2) time  to  build  it.  No
  economical  Woodbury update is applied even when it  makes  sense,  thus
  there  are  exist situations (K&lt;&lt;N) when &quot;exact low rank&quot; preconditioner
  outperforms this one.

                  NONSMOOTH NONCONVEX OPTIMIZATION
            SUBJECT TO BOX/LINEAR/NONLINEAR-NONSMOOTH CONSTRAINTS

DESCRIPTION:

The  subroutine  minimizes  function   F(x)  of N arguments subject to any
combination of:
* bound constraints
* linear inequality constraints
* linear equality constraints
* nonlinear equality constraints Gi(x)=0
* nonlinear inequality constraints Hi(x)&lt;=0

IMPORTANT: see MinNSSetAlgoAGS for important  information  on  performance
           restrictions of AGS solver.

REQUIREMENTS:
* starting point X0 must be feasible or not too far away from the feasible
  set
* F(), G(), H() are continuous, locally Lipschitz  and  continuously  (but
  not necessarily twice) differentiable in an open dense  subset  of  R^N.
  Functions F(), G() and H() may be nonsmooth and non-convex.
  Informally speaking, it means  that  functions  are  composed  of  large
  differentiable &quot;patches&quot; with nonsmoothness having  place  only  at  the
  boundaries between these &quot;patches&quot;.
  Most real-life nonsmooth  functions  satisfy  these  requirements.  Say,
  anything which involves finite number of abs(), min() and max() is  very
  likely to pass the test.
  Say, it is possible to optimize anything of the following:
  * f=abs(x0)+2*abs(x1)
  * f=max(x0,x1)
  * f=sin(max(x0,x1)+abs(x2))
* for nonlinearly constrained problems: F()  must  be  bounded from  below
  without nonlinear constraints (this requirement is due to the fact that,
  contrary to box and linear constraints, nonlinear ones  require  special
  handling).
* user must provide function value and gradient for F(), H(), G()  at  all
  points where function/gradient can be calculated. If optimizer  requires
  value exactly at the boundary between &quot;patches&quot; (say, at x=0 for f=abs(x)),
  where gradient is not defined, user may resolve tie arbitrarily (in  our
  case - return +1 or -1 at its discretion).
* NS solver supports numerical differentiation, i.e. it may  differentiate
  your function for you,  but  it  results  in  2N  increase  of  function
  evaluations. Not recommended unless you solve really small problems. See
  minnscreatef() for more information on this functionality.

USAGE:

1. User initializes algorithm state with MinNSCreate() call  and   chooses
   what NLC solver to use. There is some solver which is used by  default,
   with default settings, but you should NOT rely on  default  choice.  It
   may change in future releases of ALGLIB without notice, and no one  can
   guarantee that new solver will be  able  to  solve  your  problem  with
   default settings.

   From the other side, if you choose solver explicitly, you can be pretty
   sure that it will work with new ALGLIB releases.

   In the current release following solvers can be used:
   * AGS solver (activated with MinNSSetAlgoAGS() function)

2. User adds boundary and/or linear and/or nonlinear constraints by  means
   of calling one of the following functions:
   a) MinNSSetBC() for boundary constraints
   b) MinNSSetLC() for linear constraints
   c) MinNSSetNLC() for nonlinear constraints
   You may combine (a), (b) and (c) in one optimization problem.

3. User sets scale of the variables with MinNSSetScale() function. It   is
   VERY important to set  scale  of  the  variables,  because  nonlinearly
   constrained problems are hard to solve when variables are badly scaled.

4. User sets stopping conditions with MinNSSetCond().

5. Finally, user calls MinNSOptimize()  function  which  takes   algorithm
   state and pointer (delegate, etc) to callback function which calculates
   F/G/H.

7. User calls MinNSResults() to get solution

8. Optionally user may call MinNSRestartFrom() to solve   another  problem
   with same N but another starting point. MinNSRestartFrom()  allows   to
   reuse already initialized structure.


INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   problem dimension, N&gt;0:
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
    X       -   starting point, array[N]:
                * it is better to set X to a feasible point
                * but X can be infeasible, in which case algorithm will try
                  to find feasible point first, using X as initial
                  approximation.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure stores algorithm state

NOTE: minnscreatef() function may be used if  you  do  not  have  analytic
      gradient.   This   function  creates  solver  which  uses  numerical
      differentiation with user-specified step.

This function tells MinNS unit to use  AGS  (adaptive  gradient  sampling)
algorithm for nonsmooth constrained  optimization.  This  algorithm  is  a
slight modification of one described in  &quot;An  Adaptive  Gradient  Sampling
Algorithm for Nonsmooth Optimization&quot; by Frank E. Curtisy and Xiaocun Quez.

This optimizer has following benefits and drawbacks:
+ robustness; it can be used with nonsmooth and nonconvex functions.
+ relatively easy tuning; most of the metaparameters are easy to select.
- it has convergence of steepest descent, slower than CG/LBFGS.
- each iteration involves evaluation of ~2N gradient values  and  solution
  of 2Nx2N quadratic programming problem, which  limits  applicability  of
  algorithm by small-scale problems (up to 50-100).

IMPORTANT: this  algorithm  has  convergence  guarantees,   i.e.  it  will
           steadily move towards some stationary point of the function.

           However, &quot;stationary point&quot; does not  always  mean  &quot;solution&quot;.
           Nonsmooth problems often have &quot;flat spots&quot;,  i.e.  areas  where
           function do not change at all. Such &quot;flat spots&quot; are stationary
           points by definition, and algorithm may be caught here.

           Nonsmooth CONVEX tasks are not prone to  this  problem. Say, if
           your function has form f()=MAX(f0,f1,...), and f_i are  convex,
           then f() is convex too and you have guaranteed  convergence  to
           solution.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state
    Radius  -   initial sampling radius, &gt;=0.

                Internally multiplied  by  vector of  per-variable  scales
                specified by minnssetscale()).

                You should select relatively large sampling radius, roughly
                proportional to scaled length of the first  steps  of  the
                algorithm. Something close to 0.1 in magnitude  should  be
                good for most problems.

                AGS solver can automatically decrease radius, so too large
                radius is  not a problem (assuming that you  won't  choose
                so large radius that algorithm  will  sample  function  in
                too far away points, where gradient value is irrelevant).

                Too small radius won't cause algorithm to fail, but it may
                slow down algorithm (it may  have  to  perform  too  short
                steps).
    Penalty -   penalty coefficient for nonlinear constraints:
                * for problem with nonlinear constraints  should  be  some
                  problem-specific  positive   value,  large  enough  that
                  penalty term changes shape of the function.
                  Starting  from  some  problem-specific   value   penalty
                  coefficient becomes  large  enough  to  exactly  enforce
                  nonlinear constraints;  larger  values  do  not  improve
                  precision.
                  Increasing it too much may slow down convergence, so you
                  should choose it carefully.
                * can be zero for problems WITHOUT  nonlinear  constraints
                  (i.e. for unconstrained ones or ones with  just  box  or
                  linear constraints)
                * if you specify zero value for problem with at least  one
                  nonlinear  constraint,  algorithm  will  terminate  with
                  error code -1.

ALGORITHM OUTLINE

The very basic outline of unconstrained AGS algorithm is given below:

0. If sampling radius is below EpsX  or  we  performed  more  then  MaxIts
   iterations - STOP.
1. sample O(N) gradient values at random locations  around  current point;
   informally speaking, this sample is an implicit piecewise  linear model
   of the function, although algorithm formulation does  not  mention that
   explicitly
2. solve quadratic programming problem in order to find descent direction
3. if QP solver tells us that we  are  near  solution,  decrease  sampling
   radius and move to (0)
4. perform backtracking line search
5. after moving to new point, goto (0)

As for the constraints:
* box constraints are handled exactly  by  modification  of  the  function
  being minimized
* linear/nonlinear constraints are handled by adding L1  penalty.  Because
  our solver can handle nonsmoothness, we can  use  L1  penalty  function,
  which is an exact one  (i.e.  exact  solution  is  returned  under  such
  penalty).
* penalty coefficient for  linear  constraints  is  chosen  automatically;
  however, penalty coefficient for nonlinear constraints must be specified
  by user.

NOTE: linear (non-bound) constraints are satisfied only approximately:

* there always exists some minor violation (about current sampling  radius
  in magnitude during optimization, about EpsX in the solution) due to use
  of penalty method to handle constraints.
* numerical differentiation, if used, may  lead  to  function  evaluations
  outside  of the feasible  area,   because   algorithm  does  NOT  change
  numerical differentiation formula according to linear constraints.

If you want constraints to be  satisfied  exactly, try to reformulate your
problem  in  such  manner  that  all constraints will become boundary ones
(this kind of constraints is always satisfied exactly, both in  the  final
solution and in all intermediate points).

This function sets nonlinear constraints.

In fact, this function sets NUMBER of nonlinear  constraints.  Constraints
itself (constraint functions) are passed to minnsoptimize() method.   This
method requires user-defined vector function F[]  and  its  Jacobian  J[],
where:
* first component of F[] and first row  of  Jacobian  J[]  correspond   to
  function being minimized
* next NLEC components of F[] (and rows  of  J)  correspond  to  nonlinear
  equality constraints G_i(x)=0
* next NLIC components of F[] (and rows  of  J)  correspond  to  nonlinear
  inequality constraints H_i(x)&lt;=0

NOTE: you may combine nonlinear constraints with linear/boundary ones.  If
      your problem has mixed constraints, you  may explicitly specify some
      of them as linear ones. It may help optimizer to  handle  them  more
      efficiently.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure previously allocated with minnscreate() call.
    NLEC    -   number of Non-Linear Equality Constraints (NLEC), &gt;=0
    NLIC    -   number of Non-Linear Inquality Constraints (NLIC), &gt;=0

NOTE 1: nonlinear constraints are satisfied only  approximately!   It   is
        possible   that  algorithm  will  evaluate  function  outside   of
        the feasible area!

NOTE 2: algorithm scales variables  according  to   scale   specified   by
        minnssetscale()  function,  so  it can handle problems with  badly
        scaled variables (as long as we KNOW their scales).

        However,  there  is  no  way  to  automatically  scale   nonlinear
        constraints Gi(x) and Hi(x). Inappropriate scaling  of  Gi/Hi  may
        ruin convergence. Solving problem with  constraint  &quot;1000*G0(x)=0&quot;
        is NOT same as solving it with constraint &quot;0.001*G0(x)=0&quot;.

        It  means  that  YOU  are  the  one who is responsible for correct
        scaling of nonlinear constraints Gi(x) and Hi(x). We recommend you
        to scale nonlinear constraints in such way that I-th component  of
        dG/dX (or dH/dx) has approximately unit  magnitude  (for  problems
        with unit scale)  or  has  magnitude approximately equal to 1/S[i]
        (where S is a scale set by minnssetscale() function).

NOTE 3: nonlinear constraints are always hard to handle,  no  matter  what
        algorithm you try to use. Even basic box/linear constraints modify
        function  curvature   by  adding   valleys  and  ridges.  However,
        nonlinear constraints add valleys which are very  hard  to  follow
        due to their &quot;curved&quot; nature.

        It means that optimization with single nonlinear constraint may be
        significantly slower than optimization with multiple linear  ones.
        It is normal situation, and we recommend you to  carefully  choose
        Rho parameter of minnssetalgoags(), because too  large  value  may
        slow down convergence.

This structure stores optimization report:
* InnerIterationsCount      number of inner iterations
* OuterIterationsCount      number of outer iterations
* NCholesky                 number of Cholesky decomposition
* NMV                       number of matrix-vector products
                            (only products calculated as part of iterative
                            process are counted)
* TerminationType           completion code (see below)
* LagBC                     Lagrange multipliers for box constraints,
                            array[N], not filled by QP-BLEIC solver
* LagLC                     Lagrange multipliers for linear constraints,
                            array[MSparse+MDense], ignored by QP-BLEIC solver

=== COMPLETION CODES =====================================================

Completion codes:
* -9    failure of the automatic scale evaluation:  one  of  the  diagonal
        elements of the quadratic term is non-positive.  Specify  variable
        scales manually!
* -5    inappropriate solver was used:
        * QuickQP solver for problem with general linear constraints (dense/sparse)
* -4    BLEIC-QP or QuickQP solver found unconstrained direction
        of negative curvature (function is unbounded from
        below  even  under  constraints),  no  meaningful
        minimum can be found.
* -3    inconsistent constraints (or, maybe, feasible point is
        too hard to find). If you are sure that constraints are feasible,
        try to restart optimizer with better initial approximation.
* -1    solver error
*  1..4 successful completion
*  5    MaxIts steps was taken
*  7    stopping conditions are too stringent,
        further improvement is impossible,
        X contains best point found so far.

=== LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS =================================================

Some  optimizers  report  values of  Lagrange  multipliers  on  successful
completion (positive completion code):
* DENSE-IPM-QP and SPARSE-IPM-QP return very precise Lagrange  multipliers
  as determined during solution process.
* DENSE-AUL-QP returns approximate Lagrange multipliers  (which  are  very
  close to &quot;true&quot;  Lagrange  multipliers  except  for  overconstrained  or
  degenerate problems)

Two arrays of multipliers are returned:
* LagBC is array[N] which is loaded with multipliers from box constraints;
  LagBC[i]&gt;0 means that I-th constraint is at the  upper bound, LagBC[I]&lt;0
  means that I-th constraint is at the lower bound, LagBC[I]=0 means  that
  I-th box constraint is inactive.
* LagLC is array[MSparse+MDense] which is  loaded  with  multipliers  from
  general  linear  constraints  (former  MSparse  elements  corresponds to
  sparse part of the constraint matrix, latter MDense are  for  the  dense
  constraints, as was specified by user).
  LagLC[i]&gt;0 means that I-th constraint at  the  upper  bound,  LagLC[i]&lt;0
  means that I-th constraint is at the lower bound, LagLC[i]=0 means  that
  I-th linear constraint is inactive.

On failure (or when optimizer does not support Lagrange multipliers) these
arrays are zero-filled.

NOTE: methods  from  IPM  family  may  also  return  meaningful   Lagrange
      multipliers on completion with codes -3 (infeasibility detected) and
      -4  (unboundedness  detected).   It   is   possible   that   seeming
      infeasibility/unboundedness of the problem is due to rounding errors
      In this case last values of Lagrange multipliers are returned.

                    CONSTRAINED QUADRATIC PROGRAMMING

The subroutine creates QP optimizer. After initial creation,  it  contains
default optimization problem with zero quadratic and linear terms  and  no
constraints.

In order to actually solve something you should:
* set cost vector with minqpsetlinearterm()
* set variable bounds with minqpsetbc() or minqpsetbcall()
* specify constraint matrix with one of the following functions:
  * modern API:
    * minqpsetlc2()       for sparse two-sided constraints AL &lt;= A*x &lt;= AU
    * minqpsetlc2dense()  for dense  two-sided constraints AL &lt;= A*x &lt;= AU
    * minqpsetlc2mixed()  for mixed  two-sided constraints AL &lt;= A*x &lt;= AU
    * minqpaddlc2dense()  to add one dense row to dense constraint submatrix
    * minqpaddlc2()       to add one sparse row to sparse constraint submatrix
  * legacy API:
    * minqpsetlc()        for dense one-sided equality/inequality constraints
    * minqpsetlcsparse()  for sparse one-sided equality/inequality constraints
    * minqpsetlcmixed()   for mixed dense/sparse one-sided equality/inequality constraints
* choose appropriate QP solver and set it  and  its stopping  criteria  by
  means of minqpsetalgo??????() function
* call minqpoptimize() to run the solver and  minqpresults()  to  get  the
  solution vector and additional information.

Following solvers are recommended for convex and semidefinite problems:
* QuickQP for dense problems with box-only constraints (or no constraints
  at all)
* DENSE-IPM-QP for  convex  or  semidefinite  problems  with   medium  (up
  to several thousands) variable count, dense/sparse  quadratic  term  and
  any number  (up  to  many  thousands)  of  dense/sparse  general  linear
  constraints
* SPARSE-IPM-QP for convex  or  semidefinite  problems  with   large (many
  thousands) variable count, sparse quadratic term AND linear constraints.

If your problem happens to be nonconvex,  but  either  (a) is  effectively

This function tells solver to use BLEIC-based algorithm and sets  stopping
criteria for the algorithm.

This algorithm is intended for large-scale  problems,  possibly nonconvex,
with small number of general linear constraints. Feasible initial point is
essential for good performance.

IMPORTANT: when DENSE-IPM (or DENSE-AUL for  nonconvex  problems)  solvers
           are applicable, their performance is much better than  that  of
           BLEIC-QP.
           We recommend  you to use BLEIC only when other solvers can  not
           be used.

ALGORITHM FEATURES:

* supports dense and sparse QP problems
* supports box and general linear equality/inequality constraints
* can solve all types of problems  (convex,  semidefinite,  nonconvex)  as
  long as they are bounded from below under constraints.
  Say, it is possible to solve &quot;min{-x^2} subject to -1&lt;=x&lt;=+1&quot;.
  Of course, global  minimum  is found only  for  positive  definite   and
  semidefinite  problems.  As  for indefinite ones - only local minimum is
  found.

ALGORITHM OUTLINE:

* BLEIC-QP solver is just a driver function for MinBLEIC solver; it solves
  quadratic  programming   problem   as   general   linearly   constrained
  optimization problem, which is solved by means of BLEIC solver  (part of
  ALGLIB, active set method).

ALGORITHM LIMITATIONS:
* This algorithm is inefficient on  problems with hundreds  and  thousands
  of general inequality constraints and infeasible initial point.  Initial
  feasibility detection stage may take too long on such constraint sets.
  Consider using DENSE-IPM or DENSE-AUL instead.
* unlike QuickQP solver, this algorithm does not perform Newton steps  and
  does not use Level 3 BLAS. Being general-purpose active set  method,  it
  can activate constraints only one-by-one. Thus, its performance is lower
  than that of QuickQP.
* its precision is also a bit  inferior  to  that  of   QuickQP.  BLEIC-QP
  performs only LBFGS steps (no Newton steps), which are good at detecting
  neighborhood of the solution, buy needs many iterations to find solution
  with more than 6 digits of precision.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state
    EpsG    -   &gt;=0
                The  subroutine  finishes  its  work   if   the  condition

                * |.| means Euclidian norm
                * v - scaled constrained gradient vector, v[i]=g[i]*s[i]
                * g - gradient
                * s - scaling coefficients set by MinQPSetScale()
    EpsF    -   &gt;=0
                The  subroutine  finishes its work if exploratory steepest
                descent  step  on  k+1-th iteration  satisfies   following
                condition:  |F(k+1)-F(k)|&lt;=EpsF*max{|F(k)|,|F(k+1)|,1}
    EpsX    -   &gt;=0
                The  subroutine  finishes its work if exploratory steepest
                descent  step  on  k+1-th iteration  satisfies   following
                condition:
                * |.| means Euclidian norm
                * v - scaled step vector, v[i]=dx[i]/s[i]
                * dx - step vector, dx=X(k+1)-X(k)
                * s - scaling coefficients set by MinQPSetScale()
    MaxIts  -   maximum number of iterations. If MaxIts=0, the  number  of
                iterations is unlimited. NOTE: this  algorithm uses  LBFGS
                iterations,  which  are  relatively  cheap,  but   improve
                function value only a bit. So you will need many iterations
                to converge - from 0.1*N to 10*N, depending  on  problem's
                condition number.

IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO CALL MinQPSetScale() WHEN YOU USE THIS  ALGORITHM
BECAUSE ITS STOPPING CRITERIA ARE SCALE-DEPENDENT!

Passing EpsG=0, EpsF=0 and EpsX=0 and MaxIts=0 (simultaneously) will lead
to automatic stopping criterion selection (presently it is  small    step
length, but it may change in the future versions of ALGLIB).

This function tells QP solver to use DENSE-AUL algorithm and sets stopping

This  algorithm  is  intended  for  non-convex problems with moderate  (up

which are either (a) effectively convexified under constraints or (b) have
unique solution even with nonconvex target.

IMPORTANT: when DENSE-IPM solver is applicable, its performance is usually
           much better than that of DENSE-AUL.
           We recommend  you to use DENSE-AUL only when other solvers  can
           not be used.

ALGORITHM FEATURES:

* supports  box  and  dense/sparse  general   linear   equality/inequality
  constraints
* convergence is theoretically proved for positive-definite  (convex)   QP
  problems. Semidefinite and non-convex problems can be solved as long  as
  they  are   bounded  from  below  under  constraints,  although  without
  theoretical guarantees.

ALGORITHM OUTLINE:

* this  algorithm   is   an   augmented   Lagrangian   method  with  dense
  preconditioner (hence  its  name).
* it performs several outer iterations in order to refine  values  of  the
  Lagrange multipliers. Single outer  iteration  is  a  solution  of  some
  unconstrained optimization problem: first  it  performs  dense  Cholesky
  factorization of the Hessian in order to build preconditioner  (adaptive
  regularization is applied to enforce positive  definiteness),  and  then
  it uses L-BFGS optimizer to solve optimization problem.
* typically you need about 5-10 outer iterations to converge to solution

ALGORITHM LIMITATIONS:

* because dense Cholesky driver is used, this algorithm has O(N^2)  memory
  requirements and O(OuterIterations*N^3) minimum running time.  From  the
  practical  point  of  view,  it  limits  its  applicability  by  several
  thousands of variables.
  From  the  other  side,  variables  count  is  the most limiting factor,
  and dependence on constraint count is  much  more  lower. Assuming  that
  constraint matrix is sparse, it may handle tens of thousands  of general
  linear constraints.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

                  to be sure).
                * ItsCnt=0 means that small number of outer iterations  is
                  automatically chosen (10 iterations in current version).
                * ItsCnt=1 means that AUL algorithm performs just as usual
                  penalty method.
                * ItsCnt&gt;1 means that  AUL  algorithm  performs  specified

===== TRACING IPM SOLVER =================================================

IPM solver supports advanced tracing capabilities. You can trace algorithm
output by specifying following trace symbols (case-insensitive)  by  means
of trace_file() call:
* 'IPM'         - for basic trace of algorithm  steps and decisions.  Only
                  short scalars (function values and deltas) are  printed.
                  N-dimensional quantities like search directions are  NOT
                  printed.
* 'IPM.DETAILED'- for output of points being visited and search directions
                  This  symbol  also  implicitly  defines  'IPM'. You  can
                  control output format by additionally specifying:
                  * nothing     to output in  6-digit exponential format
                  * 'PREC.E15'  to output in 15-digit exponential format
                  * 'PREC.F6'   to output in  6-digit fixed-point format

By default trace is disabled and adds  no  overhead  to  the  optimization
process. However, specifying any of the symbols adds some  formatting  and
output-related overhead.

You may specify multiple symbols by separating them with commas:
&gt;
&gt; alglib::trace_file(&quot;IPM.DETAILED,PREC.F6&quot;, &quot;path/to/trace.log&quot;)

This function tells solver to use QuickQP  algorithm:  special  extra-fast
algorithm for problems with box-only constrants. It may  solve  non-convex
problems as long as they are bounded from below under constraints.

ALGORITHM FEATURES:
* several times faster than DENSE-IPM when running on box-only problem
* utilizes accelerated methods for activation of constraints.
* supports dense and sparse QP problems
* supports ONLY box constraints; general linear constraints are NOT
  supported by this solver
* can solve all types of problems  (convex,  semidefinite,  nonconvex)  as
  long as they are bounded from below under constraints.
  Say, it is possible to solve &quot;min{-x^2} subject to -1&lt;=x&lt;=+1&quot;.
  In convex/semidefinite case global minimum  is  returned,  in  nonconvex
  case - algorithm returns one of the local minimums.

ALGORITHM OUTLINE:

* algorithm  performs  two kinds of iterations: constrained CG  iterations
  and constrained Newton iterations
* initially it performs small number of constrained CG  iterations,  which
  can efficiently activate/deactivate multiple constraints
* after CG phase algorithm tries to calculate Cholesky  decomposition  and
  to perform several constrained Newton steps. If  Cholesky  decomposition
  failed (matrix is indefinite even under constraints),  we  perform  more
  CG iterations until we converge to such set of constraints  that  system
  matrix becomes  positive  definite.  Constrained  Newton  steps  greatly
  increase convergence speed and precision.
* algorithm interleaves CG and Newton iterations which  allows  to  handle
  indefinite matrices (CG phase) and quickly converge after final  set  of
  constraints is found (Newton phase). Combination of CG and Newton phases
  is called &quot;outer iteration&quot;.
* it is possible to turn off Newton  phase  (beneficial  for  semidefinite
  problems - Cholesky decomposition will fail too often)

ALGORITHM LIMITATIONS:

* algorithm does not support general  linear  constraints;  only  box ones
  are supported
* Cholesky decomposition for sparse problems  is  performed  with  Skyline
  Cholesky solver, which is intended for low-profile matrices. No profile-
  reducing reordering of variables is performed in this version of ALGLIB.
* problems with near-zero negative eigenvalues (or exacty zero  ones)  may
  experience about 2-3x performance penalty. The reason is  that  Cholesky
  decomposition can not be performed until we identify directions of  zero
  and negative curvature and activate corresponding boundary constraints -
  but we need a lot of trial and errors because these directions  are hard
  to notice in the matrix spectrum.
  In this case you may turn off Newton phase of algorithm.
  Large negative eigenvalues  are  not  an  issue,  so  highly  non-convex
  problems can be solved very efficiently.

    MaxOuterIts-maximum number of OUTER iterations.  One  outer  iteration
                includes some amount of CG iterations (from 5 to  ~N)  and
                one or several (usually small amount) Newton steps.  Thus,
                one outer iteration has high cost, but can greatly  reduce
                funcation value.
                Use 0 if you do not want to limit number of outer iterations.
    UseNewton-  use Newton phase or not:
                * Newton phase improves performance of  positive  definite
                  dense problems (about 2 times improvement can be observed)
                * can result in some performance penalty  on  semidefinite
                  or slightly negative definite  problems  -  each  Newton
                  phase will bring no improvement (Cholesky failure),  but
                  still will require computational time.
                * if you doubt, you can turn off this  phase  -  optimizer
                  will retain its most of its high speed.

IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO CALL MinQPSetScale() WHEN YOU USE THIS  ALGORITHM
BECAUSE ITS STOPPING CRITERIA ARE SCALE-DEPENDENT!

Passing EpsG=0, EpsF=0 and EpsX=0 and MaxIts=0 (simultaneously) will lead
to automatic stopping criterion selection (presently it is  small    step
length, but it may change in the future versions of ALGLIB).

<div style='color: green; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;'>/*************************************************************************
This function tells QP solver to  use  SPARSE-IPM  QP algorithm  and  sets
stopping criteria for the algorithm.

This  algorithm  is  intended  for convex and semidefinite  problems  with
large  variable  and  constraint  count  and  sparse  quadratic  term  and
constraints. It is possible to have  some  limited  set  of  dense  linear
constraints - they will be handled separately by dense BLAS - but the more
dense constraints you have, the more time solver needs.

IMPORTANT: internally this solver performs large  and  sparse  (N+M)x(N+M)
           triangular factorization. So it expects both quadratic term and
           constraints to be highly sparse. However, its  running  time is
           influenced by BOTH fill factor and sparsity pattern.

           Generally we expect that no more than few nonzero  elements per
           row are present. However different sparsity patterns may result
           in completely different running  times  even  given  same  fill
           factor.

           In many cases this algorithm outperforms DENSE-IPM by order  of
           magnitude. However, in some cases you may  get  better  results
           with DENSE-IPM even when solving sparse task.

IMPORTANT: this algorithm won't work for nonconvex problems, use DENSE-AUL
           or BLEIC-QP instead. If you try to  run  DENSE-IPM  on  problem
           with  indefinite  matrix  (matrix having  at least one negative
           eigenvalue) then depending on circumstances it may  either  (a)
           stall at some  arbitrary  point,  or  (b)  throw  exception  on
           failure of Cholesky decomposition.

ALGORITHM FEATURES:

* supports  box  and  dense/sparse  general   linear   equality/inequality
  constraints
* specializes on large-scale sparse problems

ALGORITHM OUTLINE:

* this  algorithm  is  an  implementation  of  interior  point  method  as
  formulated by  R.J.Vanderbei, with minor modifications to the  algorithm
  (damped Newton directions are extensively used)
* like all interior point methods, this algorithm  tends  to  converge  in
  roughly same number of iterations (between 15 and 30) independently from
  the problem dimensionality

ALGORITHM LIMITATIONS:

* this algorithm may handle moderate number  of dense constraints, usually
  no more than a thousand of dense ones without losing its efficiency.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state
    Eps     -   &gt;=0, stopping criteria. The algorithm stops  when   primal
                and dual infeasiblities as well as complementarity gap are
                less than Eps.

IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO CALL minqpsetscale() WHEN YOU USE THIS  ALGORITHM
BECAUSE ITS CONVERGENCE PROPERTIES AND STOPPING CRITERIA ARE SCALE-DEPENDENT!

NOTE: Passing EpsX=0 will lead to automatic selection of small epsilon.

This function may be useful if constraint matrix includes large number  of

        algorithmic limitations (BLEIC-QP solver is most  precise,  AUL-QP
        solver is less precise).

NOTE 2: due to backward compatibility reasons SparseC can be  larger  than
        [SparseK,N+1]. In this case only leading  [SparseK,N+1]  submatrix
        will be  used.  However,  the  rest  of  ALGLIB  has  more  strict
        requirements on the input size, so we recommend you to pass sparse
        term whose size exactly matches algorithm expectations.

format is used:
* dataset is given by NPoints*(NIn+NOut) matrix
* each row corresponds to one example
* first NIn columns are inputs, next NOut columns are outputs

For classification networks with NIn inputs and NClasses clases  following
dataset format is used:
* dataset is given by NPoints*(NIn+1) matrix
* each row corresponds to one example
* first NIn columns are inputs, last column stores class number (from 0 to
  NClasses-1).

                    storage.
    NPoints     -   points count, &gt;=0.

RESULT:
CrossEntropy/(NPoints*LN(2)).
Zero if network solves regression task.

DATASET FORMAT:

This  function  uses  two  different  dataset formats - one for regression
networks, another one for classification networks.

For regression networks with NIn inputs and NOut outputs following dataset
format is used:
* dataset is given by NPoints*(NIn+NOut) matrix
* each row corresponds to one example
* first NIn columns are inputs, next NOut columns are outputs

For classification networks with NIn inputs and NClasses clases  following
dataset format is used:
* dataset is given by NPoints*(NIn+1) matrix
* each row corresponds to one example
* first NIn columns are inputs, last column stores class number (from 0 to
  NClasses-1).

IMPORTANT: this is an &quot;expert&quot; version of the MLPTrain() function.  We  do
           not recommend you to use it unless you are pretty sure that you
           need ability to monitor training progress.

  ! COMMERCIAL EDITION OF ALGLIB:
  !
  ! Commercial Edition of ALGLIB includes following important improvements
  ! of this function:
  ! * high-performance native backend with same C# interface (C# version)
  ! * multithreading support (C++ and C# versions)
  !
  ! We recommend you to read 'Working with commercial version' section  of
  ! ALGLIB Reference Manual in order to find out how to  use  performance-
  ! related features provided by commercial edition of ALGLIB.

This function performs step-by-step training of the neural  network.  Here
&quot;step-by-step&quot; means that training starts  with  MLPStartTraining()  call,
and then user subsequently calls MLPContinueTraining() to perform one more
iteration of the training.

This  function  performs  one  more  iteration of the training and returns
either True (training continues) or False (training stopped). In case True
was returned, Network weights are updated according to the  current  state
of the optimization progress. In case False was  returned,  no  additional
updates is performed (previous update of  the  network weights moved us to
the final point, and no additional updates is needed).

EXAMPLE:
    &gt;
    &gt; [initialize network and trainer object]
    &gt;
    &gt; MLPStartTraining(Trainer, Network, True)
    &gt; while MLPContinueTraining(Trainer, Network) do
    &gt;     [visualize training progress]
    &gt;

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    S           -   trainer object
    Network     -   neural  network  structure,  which  is  used to  store
                    current state of the training process.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    Network     -   weights of the neural network  are  rewritten  by  the
                    current approximation.

NOTE: this method uses sum-of-squares error function for training.

NOTE: it is expected that trainer object settings are NOT  changed  during
      step-by-step training, i.e. no  one  changes  stopping  criteria  or
      training set during training. It is possible and there is no defense
      against  such  actions,  but  algorithm  behavior  in  such cases is
      undefined and can be unpredictable.

NOTE: It  is  expected that Network is the same one which  was  passed  to
      MLPStartTraining() function.  However,  THIS  function  checks  only
      following:
      * that number of network inputs is consistent with trainer object
        settings
      * that number of network outputs/classes is consistent with  trainer
        object settings
      * that number of network weights is the same as number of weights in
        the network passed to MLPStartTraining() function
      Exception is thrown when these conditions are violated.

      It is also expected that you do not change state of the  network  on
      your own - the only party who has right to change network during its
      training is a trainer object. Any attempt to interfere with  trainer
      may lead to unpredictable results.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    S           -   trainer object
    Network     -   neural network. It must have same number of inputs and
                    output/classes as was specified during creation of the
                    trainer object. Network is not changed  during  cross-
                    validation and is not trained - it  is  used  only  as
                    representative of its architecture. I.e., we  estimate
                    generalization properties of  ARCHITECTURE,  not  some
                    specific network.
    NRestarts   -   number of restarts, &gt;=0:
                    * NRestarts&gt;0  means  that  for  each cross-validation
                      round   specified  number   of  random  restarts  is
                      performed,  with  best  network  being  chosen after
                      training.
                    * NRestarts=0 is same as NRestarts=1
    FoldsCount  -   number of folds in k-fold cross-validation:
                    * 2&lt;=FoldsCount&lt;=size of dataset
                    * recommended value: 10.
                    * values larger than dataset size will be silently
                      truncated down to dataset size

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    Rep         -   structure which contains cross-validation estimates:
                    * Rep.RelCLSError - fraction of misclassified cases.
                    * Rep.AvgCE - acerage cross-entropy
                    * Rep.RMSError - root-mean-square error
                    * Rep.AvgError - average error
                    * Rep.AvgRelError - average relative error

NOTE: when no dataset was specified with MLPSetDataset/SetSparseDataset(),
      or subset with only one point  was  given,  zeros  are  returned  as
      estimates.

NOTE: this method performs FoldsCount cross-validation  rounds,  each  one
      with NRestarts random starts.  Thus,  FoldsCount*NRestarts  networks
      are trained in total.

NOTE: Rep.RelCLSError/Rep.AvgCE are zero on regression problems.

NOTE: on classification problems Rep.RMSError/Rep.AvgError/Rep.AvgRelError
      contain errors in prediction of posterior probabilities.

IMPORTANT: this is an &quot;expert&quot; version of the MLPTrain() function.  We  do
           not recommend you to use it unless you are pretty sure that you
           need ability to monitor training progress.

This function performs step-by-step training of the neural  network.  Here
&quot;step-by-step&quot; means that training  starts  with  MLPStartTraining() call,
and then user subsequently calls MLPContinueTraining() to perform one more
iteration of the training.

After call to this function trainer object remembers network and  is ready
to  train  it.  However,  no  training  is  performed  until first call to
MLPContinueTraining() function. Subsequent calls  to MLPContinueTraining()
will advance training progress one iteration further.

EXAMPLE:
    &gt;
    &gt; ...initialize network and trainer object....
    &gt;
    &gt; MLPStartTraining(Trainer, Network, True)
    &gt; while MLPContinueTraining(Trainer, Network) do
    &gt;     ...visualize training progress...
    &gt;

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    S           -   trainer object
    Network     -   neural network. It must have same number of inputs and
                    output/classes as was specified during creation of the
                    trainer object.
    RandomStart -   randomize network before training or not:
                    * True  means  that  network  is  randomized  and  its
                      initial state (one which was passed to  the  trainer
                      object) is lost.
                    * False  means  that  training  is  started  from  the
                      current state of the network

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    Network     -   neural network which is ready to training (weights are
                    initialized, preprocessor is initialized using current
                    training set)

NOTE: this method uses sum-of-squares error function for training.

NOTE: it is expected that trainer object settings are NOT  changed  during
      step-by-step training, i.e. no  one  changes  stopping  criteria  or
      training set during training. It is possible and there is no defense
      against  such  actions,  but  algorithm  behavior  in  such cases is
      undefined and can be unpredictable.

      select it before training &quot;conventional&quot; networks.

NOTE: when no dataset was specified with MLPSetDataset/SetSparseDataset(),
      or  single-point  dataset  was  passed,  ensemble  is filled by zero

Subroutine  trains  neural  network  with  restarts from random positions.
Algorithm  is  well  suited  for  problems  of  any dimensionality (memory
requirements and step complexity are linear by weights number).

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    Network     -   neural network with initialized geometry
    XY          -   training set
    NPoints     -   training set size
    Decay       -   weight decay constant, &gt;=0.001
                    Decay term 'Decay*||Weights||^2' is added to error

                    If you don't know what Restarts to choose, use 2.
    WStep       -   stopping criterion. Algorithm stops if  step  size  is
                    less than WStep. Recommended value - 0.01.  Zero  step
                    size means stopping after MaxIts iterations.
    MaxIts      -   stopping   criterion.  Algorithm  stops  after  MaxIts
                    iterations (NOT gradient  calculations).  Zero  MaxIts
                    means stopping when step is sufficiently small.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    Network     -   trained neural network.
    Info        -   return code:
                    * -8, if both WStep=0 and MaxIts=0

KD-tree creation

This subroutine creates KD-tree from set of X-values and optional Y-values

INPUT PARAMETERS
    XY      -   dataset, array[0..N-1,0..NX+NY-1].
                one row corresponds to one point.
                first NX columns contain X-values, next NY (NY may be zero)

    N       -   number of points, N&gt;=0.
    NX      -   space dimension, NX&gt;=1.
    NY      -   number of optional Y-values, NY&gt;=0.
    NormType-   norm type:
                * 0 denotes infinity-norm
                * 1 denotes 1-norm
                * 2 denotes 2-norm (Euclidean norm)

OUTPUT PARAMETERS
    KDT     -   KD-tree


NOTES

1. KD-tree  creation  have O(N*logN) complexity and O(N*(2*NX+NY))  memory
   requirements.
2. Although KD-trees may be used with any combination of N  and  NX,  they
   are more efficient than brute-force search only when N &gt;&gt; 4^NX. So they
   are most useful in low-dimensional tasks (NX=2, NX=3). NX=1  is another
   inefficient case, because  simple  binary  search  (without  additional
   structures) is much more efficient in such tasks than KD-trees.

This function creates buffer  structure  which  can  be  used  to  perform

KD-tree subpackage provides two sets of request functions - ones which use

because they use same buffer, which can not shared between  threads),  and
ones which use external buffer.

This function is used to initialize external buffer.

INPUT PARAMETERS
    KDT         -   KD-tree which is associated with newly created buffer

OUTPUT PARAMETERS
    Buf         -   external buffer.


IMPORTANT: KD-tree buffer should be used only with  KD-tree  object  which
           was used to initialize buffer. Any attempt to use buffer   with
           different object is dangerous - you  may  get  integrity  check

NOTE: this particular query returns unordered results, because there is no
      meaningful way of  ordering  points.  Furthermore,  no 'distance' is
      associated with points - it is either INSIDE  or OUTSIDE (so request

Distances from last query

This function retuns results stored in  the  internal  buffer  of  kd-tree
object. If you performed buffered requests (ones which  use  instances  of
kdtreerequestbuffer class), you  should  call  buffered  version  of  this
function - kdtreetsqueryresultsdistances().

INPUT PARAMETERS
    KDT     -   KD-tree
    R       -   possibly pre-allocated buffer. If X is too small to store
                result, it is resized. If size(X) is enough to store
                result, it is left unchanged.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS
    R       -   filled with distances (in corresponding norm)

NOTES
1. points are ordered by distance from the query point (first = closest)
2. if  XY is larger than required to store result, only leading part  will
   be overwritten; trailing part will be left unchanged. So  if  on  input
   XY = [[A,B],[C,D]], and result is [1,2],  then  on  exit  we  will  get
   XY = [[1,2],[C,D]]. This is done purposely to increase performance;  if
   you want function  to  resize  array  according  to  result  size,  use
   function with same name and suffix 'I'.

This function retuns results stored in  the  internal  buffer  of  kd-tree
object. If you performed buffered requests (ones which  use  instances  of
kdtreerequestbuffer class), you  should  call  buffered  version  of  this
function - kdtreetsqueryresultstags().

INPUT PARAMETERS
    KDT     -   KD-tree
    Tags    -   possibly pre-allocated buffer. If X is too small to store
                result, it is resized. If size(X) is enough to store
                result, it is left unchanged.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS
    Tags    -   filled with tags associated with points,
                or, when no tags were supplied, with zeros

NOTES
1. points are ordered by distance from the query point (first = closest)
2. if  XY is larger than required to store result, only leading part  will
   be overwritten; trailing part will be left unchanged. So  if  on  input
   XY = [[A,B],[C,D]], and result is [1,2],  then  on  exit  we  will  get
   XY = [[1,2],[C,D]]. This is done purposely to increase performance;  if
   you want function  to  resize  array  according  to  result  size,  use
   function with same name and suffix 'I'.

RESULT
    number of actual neighbors found (either K or N, if K&gt;N).

NOTES
    significant performance gain may be achieved only when Eps  is  is  on
    the order of magnitude of 1 or larger.

This  subroutine  performs  query  and  stores  its result in the internal

IMPORTANT: kd-tree buffer should be used only with  KD-tree  object  which
           was used to initialize buffer. Any attempt to use biffer   with
           different object is dangerous - you  may  get  integrity  check

K-NN query: K nearest neighbors, using external thread-local buffer.

You can call this function from multiple threads for same kd-tree instance,
assuming that different instances of buffer object are passed to different
threads.

INPUT PARAMETERS
    KDT         -   kd-tree
    Buf         -   request buffer  object  created  for  this  particular
                    instance of kd-tree structure with kdtreecreaterequestbuffer()
                    function.
    X           -   point, array[0..NX-1].
    K           -   number of neighbors to return, K&gt;=1
    SelfMatch   -   whether self-matches are allowed:
                    * if True, nearest neighbor may be the point itself
                      (if it exists in original dataset)
                    * if False, then only points with non-zero distance
                      are returned
                    * if not given, considered True

RESULT
    number of actual neighbors found (either K or N, if K&gt;N).

This  subroutine  performs  query  and  stores  its result in the internal
structures  of  the  buffer object. You can use following  subroutines  to
obtain these results (pay attention to &quot;buf&quot; in their names):
* KDTreeTsQueryResultsX() to get X-values
* KDTreeTsQueryResultsXY() to get X- and Y-values
* KDTreeTsQueryResultsTags() to get tag values
* KDTreeTsQueryResultsDistances() to get distances

IMPORTANT: kd-tree buffer should be used only with  KD-tree  object  which
           was used to initialize buffer. Any attempt to use biffer   with
           different object is dangerous - you  may  get  integrity  check
           failure (exception) because sizes of internal arrays do not fit
           to dimensions of KD-tree structure.

This function retuns results stored in  the  internal  buffer  of  kd-tree

kdtreerequestbuffer class), you  should  call  buffered  version  of  this
function - KDTreeTsqueryresultsdistances().

INPUT PARAMETERS
    KDT     -   KD-tree
    Buf     -   request  buffer  object  created   for   this   particular
                instance of kd-tree structure.
    R       -   possibly pre-allocated buffer. If X is too small to store

                result, it is left unchanged.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS
    R       -   filled with distances (in corresponding norm)

NOTES
1. points are ordered by distance from the query point (first = closest)
2. if  XY is larger than required to store result, only leading part  will
   be overwritten; trailing part will be left unchanged. So  if  on  input
   XY = [[A,B],[C,D]], and result is [1,2],  then  on  exit  we  will  get
   XY = [[1,2],[C,D]]. This is done purposely to increase performance;  if

   function with same name and suffix 'I'.

                LEVENBERG-MARQUARDT-LIKE NONLINEAR SOLVER

DESCRIPTION:
This algorithm solves system of nonlinear equations
    F[0](x[0], ..., x[n-1])   = 0
    F[1](x[0], ..., x[n-1])   = 0
    ...
    F[M-1](x[0], ..., x[n-1]) = 0
with M/N do not necessarily coincide.  Algorithm  converges  quadratically
under following conditions:
    * the solution set XS is nonempty
    * for some xs in XS there exist such neighbourhood N(xs) that:
      * vector function F(x) and its Jacobian J(x) are continuously
        differentiable on N
      * ||F(x)|| provides local error bound on N, i.e. there  exists  such
        c1, that ||F(x)||&gt;c1*distance(x,XS)
Note that these conditions are much more weaker than usual non-singularity
conditions. For example, algorithm will converge for any  affine  function
F (whether its Jacobian singular or not).


REQUIREMENTS:
Algorithm will request following information during its operation:
* function vector F[] and Jacobian matrix at given point X
* value of merit function f(x)=F[0]^2(x)+...+F[M-1]^2(x) at given point X


USAGE:
1. User initializes algorithm state with NLEQCreateLM() call
2. User tunes solver parameters with  NLEQSetCond(),  NLEQSetStpMax()  and
   other functions
3. User  calls  NLEQSolve()  function  which  takes  algorithm  state  and
   pointers (delegates, etc.) to callback functions which calculate  merit
   function value and Jacobian.
4. User calls NLEQResults() to get solution
5. Optionally, user may call NLEQRestartFrom() to  solve  another  problem
   with same parameters (N/M) but another starting  point  and/or  another
   function vector. NLEQRestartFrom() allows to reuse already  initialized
   structure.


INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   space dimension, N&gt;1:
                * if provided, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not provided, determined automatically from size of X
    M       -   system size
    X       -   starting point


OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state


NOTES:
1. you may tune stopping conditions with NLEQSetCond() function
2. if target function contains exp() or other fast growing functions,  and
   optimization algorithm makes too large steps which leads  to  overflow,
   use NLEQSetStpMax() function to bound algorithm's steps.
3. this  algorithm  is  a  slightly  modified implementation of the method
   described  in  'Levenberg-Marquardt  method  for constrained  nonlinear
   equations with strong local convergence properties' by Christian Kanzow
   Nobuo Yamashita and Masao Fukushima and further  developed  in  'On the
   convergence of a New Levenberg-Marquardt Method'  by  Jin-yan  Fan  and
   Ya-Xiang Yuan.

Inverse of Normal CDF

Returns the argument, x, for which the area under the
Gaussian probability density function (integrated from
minus infinity to x) is equal to y.


For small arguments 0 &lt; y &lt; exp(-2), the program computes
z = sqrt( -2.0 * log(y) );  then the approximation is
x = z - log(z)/z  - (1/z) P(1/z) / Q(1/z).
There are two rational functions P/Q, one for 0 &lt; y &lt; exp(-32)
and the other for y up to exp(-2).  For larger arguments,
w = y - 0.5, and  x/sqrt(2pi) = w + w**3 R(w**2)/S(w**2)).

This procedure initializes matrix norm estimator.

USAGE:
1. User initializes algorithm state with NormEstimatorCreate() call
2. User calls NormEstimatorEstimateSparse() (or NormEstimatorIteration())
3. User calls NormEstimatorResults() to get solution.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    M       -   number of rows in the matrix being estimated, M&gt;0
    N       -   number of columns in the matrix being estimated, N&gt;0
    NStart  -   number of random starting vectors
                recommended value - at least 5.
    NIts    -   number of iterations to do with best starting vector
                recommended value - at least 5.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state


NOTE: this algorithm is effectively deterministic, i.e. it always  returns
same result when repeatedly called for the same matrix. In fact, algorithm
uses randomized starting vectors, but internal  random  numbers  generator
always generates same sequence of the random values (it is a  feature, not
bug).

Algorithm can be made non-deterministic with NormEstimatorSetSeed(0) call.

Cash-Karp adaptive ODE solver.

This subroutine solves ODE  Y'=f(Y,x)  with  initial  conditions  Y(xs)=Ys
(here Y may be single variable or vector of N variables).

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    Y       -   initial conditions, array[0..N-1].
                contains values of Y[] at X[0]
    N       -   system size
    X       -   points at which Y should be tabulated, array[0..M-1]
                integrations starts at X[0], ends at X[M-1],  intermediate
                values at X[i] are returned too.
                SHOULD BE ORDERED BY ASCENDING OR BY DESCENDING!
    M       -   number of intermediate points + first point + last point:
                * M&gt;2 means that you need both Y(X[M-1]) and M-2 values at
                  intermediate points
                * M=2 means that you want just to integrate from  X[0]  to
                  X[1] and don't interested in intermediate values.
                * M=1 means that you don't want to integrate :)
                  it is degenerate case, but it will be handled correctly.
                * M&lt;1 means error
    Eps     -   tolerance (absolute/relative error on each  step  will  be
                less than Eps). When passing:
                * Eps&gt;0, it means desired ABSOLUTE error
                * Eps&lt;0, it means desired RELATIVE error.  Relative errors
                  are calculated with respect to maximum values of  Y seen
                  so far. Be careful to use this criterion  when  starting
                  from Y[] that are close to zero.
    H       -   initial  step  lenth,  it  will  be adjusted automatically
                after the first  step.  If  H=0,  step  will  be  selected
                automatically  (usualy  it  will  be  equal  to  0.001  of
                min(x[i]-x[j])).

OUTPUT PARAMETERS
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state between  subsequent
                calls of OdeSolverIteration. Used for reverse communication.
                This structure should be passed  to the OdeSolverIteration
                subroutine.

This  structure  is  used  for  detailed   reporting  about  suspected  C0
continuity violation.

=== WHAT IS TESTED =======================================================

C0 test  studies  function  values (not gradient!)  obtained  during  line
searches and monitors estimate of the Lipschitz  constant.  Sudden  spikes
usually indicate that discontinuity was detected.


=== WHAT IS REPORTED =====================================================

Actually, report retrieval function returns TWO report structures:

* one for most suspicious point found so far (one with highest  change  in
  the function value), so called &quot;strongest&quot; report
* another one for most detailed line search (more function  evaluations  =
  easier to understand what's going on) which triggered  test #0 criteria,
  so called &quot;longest&quot; report

In both cases following fields are returned:

* positive - is TRUE  when test flagged suspicious point;  FALSE  if  test
  did not notice anything (in the latter cases fields below are empty).
* fidx - is an index of the function (0 for  target  function, 1 or higher
  for nonlinear constraints) which is suspected of being &quot;non-C1&quot;
* x0[], d[] - arrays of length N which store initial point  and  direction
  for line search (d[] can be normalized, but does not have to)
* stp[], f[] - arrays of length CNT which store step lengths and  function
  values at these points; f[i] is evaluated in x0+stp[i]*d.
* stpidxa, stpidxb - we  suspect  that  function  violates  C1  continuity
  between steps #stpidxa and #stpidxb (usually we have  stpidxb=stpidxa+3,
  with  most  likely  position  of  the  violation  between  stpidxa+1 and
  stpidxa+2.

You can plot function values stored in stp[]  and  f[]  arrays  and  study
behavior of your function by your own eyes, just  to  be  sure  that  test
correctly reported C1 violation.

continuity violation as flagged by C1 test #1 (OptGuard  has several tests
for C1 continuity, this report is used by #1).

=== WHAT IS TESTED =======================================================

C1 test #1 studies individual  components  of  the  gradient  as  recorded
during line searches. Upon discovering discontinuity in the gradient  this
test records specific component which was suspected (or  one  with  highest
indication of discontinuity if multiple components are suspected).

When precise analytic gradient is provided this test is more powerful than
test #0  which  works  with  function  values  and  ignores  user-provided
gradient.  However,  test  #0  becomes  more   powerful   when   numerical
differentiation is employed (in such cases test #1 detects  higher  levels
of numerical noise and becomes too conservative).

This test also tells specific components of the gradient which violate  C1
continuity, which makes it more informative than #0, which just tells that
continuity is violated.

This structure is used to store  OptGuard  report,  i.e.  report  on   the
properties of the nonlinear function being optimized with ALGLIB.

After you tell your optimizer to activate OptGuard  this technology starts
to silently monitor function values and gradients/Jacobians  being  passed
all around during your optimization session. Depending on specific set  of
checks enabled OptGuard may perform additional function evaluations  (say,
about 3*N evaluations if you want to check analytic gradient for errors).

Upon discovering that something strange happens  (function  values  and/or
gradient components change too sharply and/or unexpectedly) OptGuard  sets
one of the &quot;suspicion  flags&quot; (without interrupting optimization session).
After optimization is done, you can examine OptGuard report.

Following report fields can be set:
* nonc0suspected
* nonc1suspected
* badgradsuspected


=== WHAT CAN BE DETECTED WITH OptGuard INTEGRITY CHECKER =================

Following  types  of  errors  in your target function (constraints) can be
caught:
a) discontinuous functions (&quot;non-C0&quot; part of the report)
b) functions with discontinuous derivative (&quot;non-C1&quot; part of the report)
c) errors in the analytic gradient provided by user

These types of errors result in optimizer  stopping  well  before reaching
solution (most often - right after encountering discontinuity).

Type A errors are usually  coding  errors  during  implementation  of  the
target function. Most &quot;normal&quot; problems involve continuous functions,  and
anyway you can't reliably optimize discontinuous function.

Type B errors are either coding errors or (in case code itself is correct)
evidence of the fact  that  your  problem  is  an  &quot;incorrect&quot;  one.  Most
optimizers (except for ones provided by MINNS subpackage) do  not  support
nonsmooth problems.

Type C errors are coding errors which often prevent optimizer from  making
even one step  or result in optimizing stopping  too  early,  as  soon  as
actual descent direction becomes too different from one suggested by user-
supplied gradient.


=== WHAT IS REPORTED =====================================================

Following set of report fields deals with discontinuous  target functions,
ones not belonging to C0 continuity class:

* nonc0suspected - is a flag which is set upon discovering some indication
  of the discontinuity. If this flag is false, the rest of &quot;non-C0&quot; fields
  should be ignored
* nonc0fidx - is an index of the function (0 for  target  function,  1  or
  higher for nonlinear constraints) which is suspected of being &quot;non-C0&quot;
* nonc0lipshitzc - a Lipchitz constant for a function which was  suspected
  of being non-continuous.
* nonc0test0positive -  set  to  indicate  specific  test  which  detected
  continuity violation (test #0)

Following set of report fields deals with discontinuous gradient/Jacobian,
i.e. with functions violating C1 continuity:

* nonc1suspected - is a flag which is set upon discovering some indication
  of the discontinuity. If this flag is false, the rest of &quot;non-C1&quot; fields
  should be ignored
* nonc1fidx - is an index of the function (0 for  target  function,  1  or
  higher for nonlinear constraints) which is suspected of being &quot;non-C1&quot;
* nonc1lipshitzc - a Lipchitz constant for a function gradient  which  was
  suspected of being non-smooth.
* nonc1test0positive -  set  to  indicate  specific  test  which  detected
  continuity violation (test #0)
* nonc1test1positive -  set  to  indicate  specific  test  which  detected
  continuity violation (test #1)

Following set of report fields deals with errors in the gradient:
* badgradsuspected - is a flad which is set upon discovering an  error  in
  the analytic gradient supplied by user
* badgradfidx - index  of   the  function  with bad gradient (0 for target
  function, 1 or higher for nonlinear constraints)
* badgradvidx - index of the variable
* badgradxbase - location where Jacobian is tested
* following  matrices  store  user-supplied  Jacobian  and  its  numerical
  differentiation version (which is assumed to be  free  from  the  coding
  errors), both of them computed near the initial point:
  * badgraduser, an array[K,N], analytic Jacobian supplied by user
  * badgradnum,  an array[K,N], numeric  Jacobian computed by ALGLIB
  Here K is a total number of  nonlinear  functions  (target  +  nonlinear
  constraints), N is a variable number.
  The  element  of  badgraduser[] with index [badgradfidx,badgradvidx]  is
  assumed to be wrong.

More detailed error log can  be  obtained  from  optimizer  by  explicitly
requesting reports for tests C0.0, C1.0, C1.1.

    N       -   size of matrix A.

This  subroutine fits piecewise linear curve to points with Ramer-Douglas-
Peucker algorithm. This  function  performs PARAMETRIC fit, i.e. it can be
used to fit curves like circles.

On  input  it  accepts dataset which describes parametric multidimensional
curve X(t), with X being vector, and t taking values in [0,N), where N  is
a number of points in dataset. As result, it returns reduced  dataset  X2,
which can be used to build  parametric  curve  X2(t),  which  approximates
X(t) with desired precision (or has specified number of sections).


INPUT PARAMETERS:
    X       -   array of multidimensional points:
                * at least N elements, leading N elements are used if more
                  than N elements were specified
                * order of points is IMPORTANT because  it  is  parametric
                  fit
                * each row of array is one point which has D coordinates
    N       -   number of elements in X
    D       -   number of dimensions (elements per row of X)
    StopM   -   stopping condition - desired number of sections:
                * at most M sections are generated by this function
                * less than M sections can be generated if we have N&lt;M
                  (or some X are non-distinct).
                * zero StopM means that algorithm does not stop after
                  achieving some pre-specified section count
    StopEps -   stopping condition - desired precision:
                * algorithm stops after error in each section is at most Eps
                * zero Eps means that algorithm does not stop after
                  achieving some pre-specified precision

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    X2      -   array of corner points for piecewise approximation,
                has length NSections+1 or zero (for NSections=0).
    Idx2    -   array of indexes (parameter values):
                * has length NSections+1 or zero (for NSections=0).
                * each element of Idx2 corresponds to same-numbered
                  element of X2
                * each element of Idx2 is index of  corresponding  element
                  of X2 at original array X, i.e. I-th  row  of  X2  is
                  Idx2[I]-th row of X.
                * elements of Idx2 can be treated as parameter values
                  which should be used when building new parametric curve
                * Idx2[0]=0, Idx2[NSections]=N-1
    NSections-  number of sections found by algorithm, NSections&lt;=M,
                NSections can be zero for degenerate datasets
                (N&lt;=1 or all X[] are non-distinct).

NOTE: algorithm stops after:
      a) dividing curve into StopM sections
      b) achieving required precision StopEps
      c) dividing curve into N-1 sections
      If both StopM and StopEps are non-zero, algorithm is stopped by  the
      FIRST criterion which is satisfied. In case both StopM  and  StopEps
      are zero, algorithm stops because of (c).

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    P   -   parametric spline interpolant


NOTES:
* this function  assumes  that there all consequent points  are  distinct.
  I.e. (x0,y0)&lt;&gt;(x1,y1), (x1,y1)&lt;&gt;(x2,y2),  (x2,y2)&lt;&gt;(x3,y3)  and  so  on.
  However, non-consequent points may coincide, i.e. we can  have  (x0,y0)=
  =(x2,y2).
* last point of sequence is NOT equal to the first  point.  You  shouldn't
  make curve &quot;explicitly periodic&quot; by making them equal.

Principal components analysis

This function builds orthogonal basis  where  first  axis  corresponds  to
direction with maximum variance, second axis  maximizes  variance  in  the
subspace orthogonal to first axis and so on.

This function builds FULL basis, i.e. returns N vectors  corresponding  to
ALL directions, no matter how informative. If you need  just a  few  (say,
10 or 50) of the most important directions, you may find it faster to  use
one of the reduced versions:
* pcatruncatedsubspace() - for subspace iteration based method

It should be noted that, unlike LDA, PCA does not use class labels.

    numerical properties of polynomial. For example, if P was obtained  as
    result of interpolation on [-1,+1],  you  can  set  C=0  and  S=1  and
    represent  P  as sum of 1, x, x^2, x^3 and so on. In most cases you it
    is exactly what you need.

    However, if your interpolation model was built on [999,1001], you will
    see significant growth of numerical errors when using {1, x, x^2, x^3}
    as basis. Representing P as sum of 1, (x-1000), (x-1000)^2, (x-1000)^3
    will be better option. Such representation can be  obtained  by  using
    1000.0 as offset C and 1.0 as scale S.

2.  power basis is ill-conditioned and tricks described above can't  solve
    this problem completely. This function  will  return  coefficients  in
    any  case,  but  for  N&gt;8  they  will  become unreliable. However, N's
    less than 5 are pretty safe.

3.  barycentric interpolant passed as P may be either polynomial  obtained
    from  polynomial  interpolation/ fitting or rational function which is
    NOT polynomial. We can't distinguish between these two cases, and this
    algorithm just tries to work assuming that P IS a polynomial.  If not,
    algorithm will return results, but they won't have any meaning.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS

NOTES:
1.  this function accepts offset and scale, which can be  set  to  improve
    numerical properties of polynomial. For example, if you interpolate on
    [-1,+1],  you  can  set C=0 and S=1 and convert from sum of 1, x, x^2,
    x^3 and so on. In most cases you it is exactly what you need.

    However, if your interpolation model was built on [999,1001], you will
    see significant growth of numerical errors when using {1, x, x^2, x^3}
    as  input  basis.  Converting  from  sum  of  1, (x-1000), (x-1000)^2,
    (x-1000)^3 will be better option (you have to specify 1000.0 as offset
    C and 1.0 as scale S).

2.  power basis is ill-conditioned and tricks described above can't  solve
    this problem completely. This function  will  return barycentric model
    in any case, but for N&gt;8 accuracy well degrade. However, N's less than
    5 are pretty safe.

Polynomial root finding.

This function returns all roots of the polynomial
    P(x) = a0 + a1*x + a2*x^2 + ... + an*x^n
Both real and complex roots are returned (see below).

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    A       -   array[N+1], polynomial coefficients:
                * A[0] is constant term
                * A[N] is a coefficient of X^N
    N       -   polynomial degree

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    X       -   array of complex roots:
                * for isolated real root, X[I] is strictly real: IMAGE(X[I])=0
                * complex roots are always returned in pairs - roots occupy
                  positions I and I+1, with:
                  * X[I+1]=Conj(X[I])
                  * IMAGE(X[I]) &gt; 0
                  * IMAGE(X[I+1]) = -IMAGE(X[I]) &lt; 0
                * multiple real roots may have non-zero imaginary part due
                  to roundoff errors. There is no reliable way to distinguish
                  real root of multiplicity 2 from two  complex  roots  in
                  the presence of roundoff errors.
    Rep     -   report, additional information, following fields are set:
                * Rep.MaxErr - max( |P(xi)| )  for  i=0..N-1.  This  field
                  allows to quickly estimate &quot;quality&quot; of the roots  being
                  returned.

NOTE:   this function uses companion matrix method to find roots. In  case
        internal EVD  solver  fails  do  find  eigenvalues,  exception  is
        generated.

NOTE:   roots are not &quot;polished&quot; and  no  matrix  balancing  is  performed
        for them.

Rational interpolant without poles

The subroutine constructs the rational interpolating function without real
poles  (see  'Barycentric rational interpolation with no  poles  and  high
rates of approximation', Michael S. Floater. and  Kai  Hormann,  for  more
information on this subject).

Input parameters:
    X   -   interpolation nodes, array[0..N-1].
    Y   -   function values, array[0..N-1].
    N   -   number of nodes, N&gt;0.
    D   -   order of the interpolation scheme, 0 &lt;= D &lt;= N-1.
            D&lt;0 will cause an error.
            D&gt;=N it will be replaced with D=N-1.
            if you don't know what D to choose, use small value about 3-5.

Output parameters:
    B   -   barycentric interpolant.

Note:
    this algorithm always succeeds and calculates the weights  with  close
    to machine precision.

contain zero coefficients, but after call to this function  we  will  have
coefficients which were calculated in order to fit our dataset.

After you called this function you can call RBFCalc(),  RBFGridCalc()  and
other model calculation functions.

    Rep     -   report:
                * Rep.TerminationType:

                         error   code, other  algorithms  can  handle non-
                         distinct nodes.
                  * -4 - nonconvergence of the internal SVD solver
                  * -3   incorrect model construction algorithm was chosen:
                         QNN or RBF-ML, combined with one of the incompatible
                         features - NX=1 or NX&gt;3; points with per-dimension
                         scales.
                  *  1 - successful termination
                  *  8 - a termination request was submitted via
                         rbfrequesttermination() function.

                Fields which are set only by modern RBF solvers (hierarchical
                or nonnegative; older solvers like QNN and ML initialize these
                fields by NANs):
                * rep.rmserror - root-mean-square error at nodes
                * rep.maxerror - maximum error at nodes

                Fields are used for debugging purposes:
                * Rep.IterationsCount - iterations count of the LSQR solver
                * Rep.NMV - number of matrix-vector products
                * Rep.ARows - rows count for the system matrix

NOTE:  failure  to  build  model will leave current state of the structure
unchanged.

This function creates RBF  model  for  a  scalar (NY=1)  or  vector (NY&gt;1)

Newly created model is empty. It can be used for interpolation right after
creation, but it just returns zeros. You have to add points to the  model,
tune interpolation settings, and then  call  model  construction  function
rbfbuildmodel() which will update model according to your specification.

USAGE:
1. User creates model with rbfcreate()
2. User adds dataset with rbfsetpoints() (points do NOT have to  be  on  a
   regular grid) or rbfsetpointsandscales().
3. (OPTIONAL) User chooses polynomial term by calling:
   * rbflinterm() to set linear term
   * rbfconstterm() to set constant term
   * rbfzeroterm() to set zero term
   By default, linear term is used.
4. User tweaks algorithm properties with  rbfsetalgohierarchical()  method
   (or chooses one of the legacy algorithms - QNN  (rbfsetalgoqnn)  or  ML
   (rbfsetalgomultilayer)).
5. User calls rbfbuildmodel() function which rebuilds model  according  to
   the specification
6. User may call rbfcalc() to calculate model value at the specified point,
   rbfgridcalc() to  calculate   model  values at the points of the regular
   grid. User may extract model coefficients with rbfunpack() call.

IMPORTANT: we recommend you to use latest model construction  algorithm  -
           hierarchical RBFs, which is activated by rbfsetalgohierarchical()
           function. This algorithm is the fastest one, and  most  memory-
           efficient.
           However,  it  is  incompatible  with older versions  of  ALGLIB
           (pre-3.11). So, if you serialize hierarchical model,  you  will
           be unable to load it in pre-3.11 ALGLIB. Other model types (QNN
           and RBF-ML) are still backward-compatible.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    NX      -   dimension of the space, NX&gt;=1
    NY      -   function dimension, NY&gt;=1

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    S       -   RBF model (initially equals to zero)

NOTE 1: memory requirements. RBF models require amount of memory  which is
        proportional  to the number of data points. Some additional memory
        is allocated during model construction, but most of this memory is
        freed after model coefficients  are  calculated.  Amount  of  this
        additional memory depends on model  construction  algorithm  being
        used.

NOTE 2: prior to ALGLIB version 3.11, RBF models supported  only  NX=2  or
        NX=3. Any  attempt  to  create  single-dimensional  or  more  than
        3-dimensional RBF model resulted in exception.

        ALGLIB 3.11 supports any NX&gt;0, but models created with  NX!=2  and
        NX!=3 are incompatible with (a) older versions of ALGLIB, (b)  old
        model construction algorithms (QNN or RBF-ML).

        So, if you create a model with NX=2 or NX=3,  then,  depending  on
        specific  model construction algorithm being chosen, you will (QNN
        and RBF-ML) or will not (HierarchicalRBF) get backward compatibility
        with older versions of ALGLIB. You have a choice here.

        However, if you create a model with NX neither 2 nor 3,  you  have
        no backward compatibility from the start, and you  are  forced  to
        use hierarchical RBFs and ALGLIB 3.11 or later.

<pre class=source>
<div style='color: green; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;'>/*************************************************************************
This function creates buffer  structure  which  can  be  used  to  perform
parallel  RBF  model  evaluations  (with  one  RBF  model  instance  being
used from multiple threads, as long as  different  threads  use  different
instances of buffer).

This buffer object can be used with  rbftscalcbuf()  function  (here  &quot;ts&quot;
stands for &quot;thread-safe&quot;, &quot;buf&quot; is a suffix which denotes  function  which
reuses previously allocated output space).

How to use it:
* create RBF model structure with rbfcreate()
* load data, tune parameters
* call rbfbuildmodel()
* call rbfcreatecalcbuffer(), once per thread working with RBF model  (you
  should call this function only AFTER call to rbfbuildmodel(), see  below
  for more information)
* call rbftscalcbuf() from different threads,  with  each  thread  working
  with its own copy of buffer object.

INPUT PARAMETERS
    S           -   RBF model

OUTPUT PARAMETERS
    Buf         -   external buffer.


IMPORTANT: buffer object should be used only with  RBF model object  which
           was used to initialize buffer. Any attempt to use buffer   with
           different object is dangerous - you may  get  memory  violation
           error because sizes of internal arrays do not fit to dimensions
           of RBF structure.

IMPORTANT: you  should  call  this function only for model which was built
           with rbfbuildmodel() function, after successful  invocation  of
           rbfbuildmodel().  Sizes   of   some   internal  structures  are
           determined only after model is built, so buffer object  created
           before model  construction  stage  will  be  useless  (and  any
           attempt to use it will result in exception).

    X1      -   array of grid nodes, second coordinates, array[N1]
                Must be ordered by ascending. Exception is generated
                if the array is not correctly ordered.

    FlagY   -   array[N0*N1*N2]:
                * Y[I0+I1*N0+I2*N0*N1] corresponds to node (X0[I0],X1[I1],X2[I2])
                * it is a &quot;bitmap&quot; array which contains  False  for  nodes
                  which are NOT calculated, and True for nodes  which  are
                  required.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    Y       -   function values, array[NY*N0*N1*N2], where NY is a  number
                of &quot;output&quot; vector values (this function  supports vector-
                valued RBF models):
                * Y[K+NY*(I0+I1*N0+I2*N0*N1)]=F_k(X0[I0],X1[I1],X2[I2]),
                  for K=0...NY-1, I0=0...N0-1, I1=0...N1-1, I2=0...N2-1.
                * elements of Y[] which correspond  to  FlagY[]=True   are
                  loaded by model values (which may be  exactly  zero  for
                  some nodes).
                * elements of Y[] which correspond to FlagY[]=False MAY be
                  initialized by zeros OR may be calculated. This function
                  processes  grid  as  a  hierarchy  of  nested blocks and
                  micro-rows. If just one element of micro-row is required,
                  entire micro-row (up to 8 nodes in the current  version,
                  but no promises) is calculated.

NOTE: this function supports weakly ordered grid nodes, i.e. you may  have
      X[i]=X[i+1] for some i. It does  not  provide  you  any  performance
      benefits  due  to   duplication  of  points,  just  convenience  and
      flexibility.

NOTE: this  function  is  re-entrant,  i.e.  you  may  use  same  rbfmodel
      structure in multiple threads calling  this function  for  different
      grids.

This  function  sets  RBF interpolation algorithm. ALGLIB supports several
RBF algorithms with different properties.

This  algorithm is called Hierarchical RBF. It  similar  to  its  previous
incarnation, RBF-ML, i.e.  it  also  builds  a  sequence  of  models  with
decreasing radii. However, it uses more economical way of  building  upper
layers (ones with large radii), which results in faster model construction
and evaluation, as well as smaller memory footprint during construction.

This algorithm has following important features:
* ability to handle millions of points
* controllable smoothing via nonlinearity penalization
* support for NX-dimensional models with NX=1 or NX&gt;3 (unlike QNN or RBF-ML)
* support for specification of per-dimensional  radii  via  scale  vector,
  which is set by means of rbfsetpointsandscales() function. This  feature
  is useful if you solve  spatio-temporal  interpolation  problems,  where
  different radii are required for spatial and temporal dimensions.

Running times are roughly proportional to:
* N*log(N)*NLayers - for model construction
* N*NLayers - for model evaluation
You may see that running time does not depend on search radius  or  points
density, just on number of layers in the hierarchy.

IMPORTANT: this model construction algorithm was introduced in ALGLIB 3.11
           and  produces  models  which  are  INCOMPATIBLE  with  previous
           versions of ALGLIB. You can  not  unserialize  models  produced
           with this function in ALGLIB 3.10 or earlier.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    S       -   RBF model, initialized by rbfcreate() call
    RBase   -   RBase parameter, RBase&gt;0
    NLayers -   NLayers parameter, NLayers&gt;0, recommended value  to  start
                with - about 5.
    LambdaNS-   &gt;=0, nonlinearity penalty coefficient, negative values are
                not allowed. This parameter adds controllable smoothing to
                the problem, which may reduce noise. Specification of non-
                zero lambda means that in addition to fitting error solver
                will  also  minimize   LambdaNS*|S''(x)|^2  (appropriately
                generalized to multiple dimensions.

                Specification of exactly zero value means that no  penalty
                is added  (we  do  not  even  evaluate  matrix  of  second
                derivatives which is necessary for smoothing).

                Calculation of nonlinearity penalty is costly - it results
                in  several-fold  increase  of  model  construction  time.
                Evaluation time remains the same.

                Optimal  lambda  is  problem-dependent and requires  trial
                and  error.  Good  value to  start  from  is  1e-5...1e-6,
                which corresponds to slightly noticeable smoothing  of the
                function.  Value  1e-2  usually  means  that  quite  heavy
                smoothing is applied.

TUNING ALGORITHM

In order to use this algorithm you have to choose three parameters:
* initial radius RBase
* number of layers in the model NLayers
* penalty coefficient LambdaNS

Initial radius is easy to choose - you can pick any number  several  times
larger  than  the  average  distance between points. Algorithm won't break
down if you choose radius which is too large (model construction time will
increase, but model will be built correctly).

Choose such number of layers that RLast=RBase/2^(NLayers-1)  (radius  used
by  the  last  layer)  will  be  smaller than the typical distance between
points.  In  case  model  error  is  too large, you can increase number of
layers.  Having  more  layers  will make model construction and evaluation
proportionally slower, but it will allow you to have model which precisely
fits your data. From the other side, if you want to  suppress  noise,  you
can DECREASE number of layers to make your model less flexible (or specify
non-zero LambdaNS).

TYPICAL ERRORS

1. Using too small number of layers - RBF models with large radius are not
   flexible enough to reproduce small variations in the  target  function.
   You  need  many  layers  with  different radii, from large to small, in
   order to have good model.

2. Using  initial  radius  which  is  too  small.  You will get model with
   &quot;holes&quot; in the areas which are too far away from interpolation centers.
   However, algorithm will work correctly (and quickly) in this case.

DEPRECATED:since version 3.11 ALGLIB includes new RBF  model  construction
           algorithm, Hierarchical  RBF.  This  algorithm  is  faster  and
           requires less memory than QNN and RBF-ML. It is especially good
           for large-scale interpolation problems. So, we recommend you to
           consider Hierarchical RBF as default option.

==========================================================================

This  function  sets  RBF interpolation algorithm. ALGLIB supports several
RBF algorithms with different properties.

This  algorithm is called RBF-ML. It builds  multilayer  RBF  model,  i.e.
model with subsequently decreasing  radii,  which  allows  us  to  combine
smoothness (due to  large radii of  the first layers) with  exactness (due
to small radii of the last layers) and fast convergence.

Internally RBF-ML uses many different  means  of acceleration, from sparse
matrices  to  KD-trees,  which  results in algorithm whose working time is
roughly proportional to N*log(N)*Density*RBase^2*NLayers,  where  N  is  a
number of points, Density is an average density if points per unit of  the
interpolation space, RBase is an initial radius, NLayers is  a  number  of
layers.

RBF-ML is good for following kinds of interpolation problems:
1. &quot;exact&quot; problems (perfect fit) with well separated points
2. least squares problems with arbitrary distribution of points (algorithm
   gives  perfect  fit  where it is possible, and resorts to least squares
   fit in the hard areas).
3. noisy problems where  we  want  to  apply  some  controlled  amount  of
   smoothing.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    S       -   RBF model, initialized by RBFCreate() call
    RBase   -   RBase parameter, RBase&gt;0
    NLayers -   NLayers parameter, NLayers&gt;0, recommended value  to  start
                with - about 5.
    LambdaV -   regularization value, can be useful when  solving  problem
                in the least squares sense.  Optimal  lambda  is  problem-
                dependent and require trial and error. In our  experience,
                good lambda can be as large as 0.1, and you can use  0.001
                as initial guess.
                Default  value  - 0.01, which is used when LambdaV is  not
                given.  You  can  specify  zero  value,  but  it  is   not
                recommended to do so.

TUNING ALGORITHM

In order to use this algorithm you have to choose three parameters:
* initial radius RBase
* number of layers in the model NLayers
* regularization coefficient LambdaV

Initial radius is easy to choose - you can pick any number  several  times
larger  than  the  average  distance between points. Algorithm won't break
down if you choose radius which is too large (model construction time will
increase, but model will be built correctly).

Choose such number of layers that RLast=RBase/2^(NLayers-1)  (radius  used
by  the  last  layer)  will  be  smaller than the typical distance between
points.  In  case  model  error  is  too large, you can increase number of
layers.  Having  more  layers  will make model construction and evaluation
proportionally slower, but it will allow you to have model which precisely
fits your data. From the other side, if you want to  suppress  noise,  you
can DECREASE number of layers to make your model less flexible.

Regularization coefficient LambdaV controls smoothness of  the  individual
models built for each layer. We recommend you to use default value in case
you don't want to tune this parameter,  because  having  non-zero  LambdaV
accelerates and stabilizes internal iterative algorithm. In case you  want
to suppress noise you can use  LambdaV  as  additional  parameter  (larger
value = more smoothness) to tune.

TYPICAL ERRORS

1. Using  initial  radius  which is too large. Memory requirements  of the
   RBF-ML are roughly proportional to N*Density*RBase^2 (where Density  is
   an average density of points per unit of the interpolation  space).  In
   the extreme case of the very large RBase we will need O(N^2)  units  of
   memory - and many layers in order to decrease radius to some reasonably
   small value.

2. Using too small number of layers - RBF models with large radius are not
   flexible enough to reproduce small variations in the  target  function.
   You  need  many  layers  with  different radii, from large to small, in
   order to have good model.

3. Using  initial  radius  which  is  too  small.  You will get model with
   &quot;holes&quot; in the areas which are too far away from interpolation centers.
   However, algorithm will work correctly (and quickly) in this case.

4. Using too many layers - you will get too large and too slow model. This
   model  will  perfectly  reproduce  your function, but maybe you will be
   able to achieve similar results with less layers (and less memory).

           consider Hierarchical RBF as default option.

==========================================================================

This  function  sets  RBF interpolation algorithm. ALGLIB supports several
RBF algorithms with different properties.

This algorithm is called RBF-QNN and  it  is  good  for  point  sets  with
following properties:
a) all points are distinct
b) all points are well separated.
c) points  distribution  is  approximately  uniform.  There is no &quot;contour
   lines&quot;, clusters of points, or other small-scale structures.

Algorithm description:
1) interpolation centers are allocated to data points
2) interpolation radii are calculated as distances to the  nearest centers
   times Q coefficient (where Q is a value from [0.75,1.50]).
3) after  performing (2) radii are transformed in order to avoid situation
   when single outlier has very large radius and  influences  many  points
   across all dataset. Transformation has following form:
       new_r[i] = min(r[i],Z*median(r[]))
   where r[i] is I-th radius, median()  is a median  radius across  entire
   dataset, Z is user-specified value which controls amount  of  deviation
   from median radius.

When (a) is violated,  we  will  be unable to build RBF model. When (b) or
(c) are violated, model will be built, but interpolation quality  will  be
low. See http://www.alglib.net/interpolation/ for more information on this
subject.

This algorithm is used by default.

Additional Q parameter controls smoothness properties of the RBF basis:
* Q&lt;0.75 will give perfectly conditioned basis,  but  terrible  smoothness
  properties (RBF interpolant will have sharp peaks around function values)
* Q around 1.0 gives good balance between smoothness and condition number
* Q&gt;1.5 will lead to badly conditioned systems and slow convergence of the
  underlying linear solver (although smoothness will be very good)
* Q&gt;2.0 will effectively make optimizer useless because it won't  converge
  within reasonable amount of iterations. It is possible to set such large
  Q, but it is advised not to do so.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    S       -   RBF model, initialized by RBFCreate() call
    Q       -   Q parameter, Q&gt;0, recommended value - 1.0
    Z       -   Z parameter, Z&gt;0, recommended value - 5.0

NOTE: this   function  has   some   serialization-related  subtleties.  We
      recommend you to study serialization examples from ALGLIB  Reference
      Manual if you want to perform serialization of your models.

This function adds dataset.

This function overrides results of the previous calls, i.e. multiple calls

IMPORTANT: ALGLIB version 3.11 and later allows you to specify  a  set  of
           per-dimension scales. Interpolation radii are multiplied by the
           scale vector. It may be useful if you have mixed spatio-temporal
           data (say, a set of 3D slices recorded at different times).
           You should call rbfsetpointsandscales() function  to  use  this
           feature.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    S       -   RBF model, initialized by rbfcreate() call.
    XY      -   points, array[N,NX+NY]. One row corresponds to  one  point
                in the dataset. First NX elements  are  coordinates,  next
                NY elements are function values. Array may  be larger than
                specified, in  this  case  only leading [N,NX+NY] elements
                will be used.
    N       -   number of points in the dataset

After you've added dataset and (optionally) tuned algorithm  settings  you
should call rbfbuildmodel() in order to build a model for you.

NOTE: dataset added by this function is not saved during model serialization.
      MODEL ITSELF is serialized, but data used to build it are not.

      So, if you 1) add dataset to  empty  RBF  model,  2)  serialize  and
      unserialize it, then you will get an empty RBF model with no dataset
      being attached.

      From the other side, if you call rbfbuildmodel() between (1) and (2),
      then after (2) you will get your fully constructed RBF model  -  but
      again with no dataset attached, so subsequent calls to rbfbuildmodel()
      will produce empty model.

This function adds dataset and a vector of per-dimension scales.

It may be useful if you have mixed spatio-temporal data - say, a set of 3D
slices recorded at different times. Such data typically require  different
RBF radii for spatial and temporal dimensions. ALGLIB solves this  problem
by specifying single RBF radius, which is (optionally) multiplied  by  the
scale vector.

This function overrides results of the previous calls, i.e. multiple calls
of this function will result in only the last set being added.

IMPORTANT: only HierarchicalRBF algorithm can work with scaled points. So,
           using this function results in RBF models which can be used  in
           ALGLIB 3.11 or later. Previous versions of the library will  be
           unable  to unserialize models produced by HierarchicalRBF algo.

           Any attempt to use this function with RBF-ML or QNN  algorithms
           will result  in  -3  error  code   being   returned  (incorrect
           algorithm).

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    R       -   RBF model, initialized by rbfcreate() call.

Subroutine performing the Schur decomposition of a general matrix by using
the QR algorithm with multiple shifts.

COMMERCIAL EDITION OF ALGLIB:

  ! Commercial version of ALGLIB includes one  important  improvement   of
  ! this function, which can be used from C++ and C#:
  ! * Intel MKL support (lightweight Intel MKL is shipped with ALGLIB)
  !
  ! Intel MKL gives approximately constant  (with  respect  to  number  of
  ! worker threads) acceleration factor which depends on CPU  being  used,
  ! problem  size  and  &quot;baseline&quot;  ALGLIB  edition  which  is  used   for
  ! comparison.
  !
  ! Multithreaded acceleration is NOT supported for this function.
  !
  ! We recommend you to read 'Working with commercial version' section  of
  ! ALGLIB Reference Manual in order to find out how to  use  performance-
  ! related features provided by commercial edition of ALGLIB.

The source matrix A is represented as S'*A*S = T, where S is an orthogonal
matrix (Schur vectors), T - upper quasi-triangular matrix (with blocks of
sizes 1x1 and 2x2 on the main diagonal).

Input parameters:
    A   -   matrix to be decomposed.
            Array whose indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..N-1].
    N   -   size of A, N&gt;=0.


Output parameters:
    A   -   contains matrix T.
            Array whose indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..N-1].
    S   -   contains Schur vectors.
            Array whose indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..N-1].

Note 1:
    The block structure of matrix T can be easily recognized: since all
    the elements below the blocks are zeros, the elements a[i+1,i] which
    are equal to 0 show the block border.

Note 2:
    The algorithm performance depends on the value of the internal parameter
    NS of the InternalSchurDecomposition subroutine which defines the number
    of shifts in the QR algorithm (similarly to the block width in block-matrix
    algorithms in linear algebra). If you require maximum performance on
    your machine, it is recommended to adjust this parameter manually.

Result:
    True,
        if the algorithm has converged and parameters A and S contain the result.
    False,
        if the algorithm has not converged.

Algorithm implemented on the basis of the DHSEQR subroutine (LAPACK 3.0 library).

NOTES ON THE SPARSE STORAGE FORMATS

Sparse matrices can be stored using several formats:
* Hash-Table representation
* Compressed Row Storage (CRS)
* Skyline matrix storage (SKS)

Each of the formats has benefits and drawbacks:
* Hash-table is good for dynamic operations (insertion of new elements),
  but does not support linear algebra operations
* CRS is good for operations like matrix-vector or matrix-matrix products,
  but its initialization is less convenient - you have to tell row   sizes
  at the initialization, and you have to fill  matrix  only  row  by  row,
  from left to right.
* SKS is a special format which is used to store triangular  factors  from
  Cholesky factorization. It does not support  dynamic  modification,  and
  support for linear algebra operations is very limited.

Tables below outline information about these two formats:

This function creates sparse matrix in a Hash-Table format.

This function creates Hast-Table matrix, which can be  converted  to  CRS
format after its initialization is over. Typical  usage  scenario  for  a
sparse matrix is:
1. creation in a Hash-Table format
2. insertion of the matrix elements
3. conversion to the CRS representation
4. matrix is passed to some linear algebra algorithm

Some  information  about  different matrix formats can be found below, in
the &quot;NOTES&quot; section.

INPUT PARAMETERS
    M           -   number of rows in a matrix, M&gt;=1
    N           -   number of columns in a matrix, N&gt;=1
    K           -   K&gt;=0, expected number of non-zero elements in a matrix.
                    K can be inexact approximation, can be less than actual
                    number  of  elements  (table will grow when needed) or
                    even zero).
                    It is important to understand that although hash-table
                    may grow automatically, it is better to  provide  good
                    estimate of data size.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS
    S           -   sparse M*N matrix in Hash-Table representation.
                    All elements of the matrix are zero.

NOTE 1

Hash-tables use memory inefficiently, and they have to keep  some  amount
of the &quot;spare memory&quot; in order to have good performance. Hash  table  for
matrix with K non-zero elements will  need  C*K*(8+2*sizeof(int))  bytes,
where C is a small constant, about 1.5-2 in magnitude.

CRS storage, from the other side, is  more  memory-efficient,  and  needs
just K*(8+sizeof(int))+M*sizeof(int) bytes, where M is a number  of  rows
in a matrix.

When you convert from the Hash-Table to CRS  representation, all unneeded
memory will be freed.

NOTE 2

Comments of SparseMatrix structure outline  information  about  different
sparse storage formats. We recommend you to read them before starting  to
use ALGLIB sparse matrices.

NOTE 3

This function completely  overwrites S with new sparse matrix. Previously
allocated storage is NOT reused. If you  want  to reuse already allocated
memory, call SparseCreateBuf function.

This  function  is  used  to enumerate all elements of the sparse matrix.
Before  first  call  user  initializes  T0 and T1 counters by zero. These
counters are used to remember current position in a  matrix;  after  each
call they are updated by the function.

Subsequent calls to this function return non-zero elements of the  sparse
matrix, one by one. If you enumerate CRS matrix, matrix is traversed from
left to right, from top to bottom. In case you enumerate matrix stored as
Hash table, elements are returned in random order.

EXAMPLE
    &gt; T0=0
    &gt; T1=0
    &gt; while SparseEnumerate(S,T0,T1,I,J,V) do
    &gt;     ....do something with I,J,V

INPUT PARAMETERS

    T0          -   internal counter
    T1          -   internal counter

OUTPUT PARAMETERS
    T0          -   new value of the internal counter
    T1          -   new value of the internal counter
    I           -   row index of non-zero element, 0&lt;=I&lt;M.
    J           -   column index of non-zero element, 0&lt;=J&lt;N
    V           -   value of the T-th element

RESULT
    True in case of success (next non-zero element was retrieved)

NOTE: you may call SparseRewriteExisting() during enumeration, but it  is
      THE  ONLY  matrix  modification  function  you  can  call!!!  Other

    OpS         -   operation type:
                    * OpS=0     =&gt;  op(S) = S
                    * OpS=1     =&gt;  op(S) = S^T
    X           -   input vector, must have at least Cols(op(S))+IX elements
    IX          -   subvector offset
    Beta        -   destination coefficient
    Y           -   preallocated output array, must have at least Rows(op(S))+IY elements
    IY          -   subvector offset

OUTPUT PARAMETERS
    Y           -   elements [IY...IY+Rows(op(S))-1] are replaced by result,
                    other elements are not modified

HANDLING OF SPECIAL CASES:
* below M=Rows(op(S)) and N=Cols(op(S)). Although current  ALGLIB  version
  does not allow you to  create  zero-sized  sparse  matrices,  internally
  ALGLIB  can  deal  with  such matrices. So, comments for M or N equal to
  zero are for internal use only.
* if M=0, then subroutine does nothing. It does not even touch arrays.
* if N=0 or Alpha=0.0, then:
  * if Beta=0, then Y is filled by zeros. S and X are  not  referenced  at
    all. Initial values of Y are ignored (we do not  multiply  Y by  zero,
    we just rewrite it by zeros)
  * if Beta&lt;&gt;0, then Y is replaced by Beta*Y
* if M&gt;0, N&gt;0, Alpha&lt;&gt;0, but  Beta=0, then  Y is replaced by alpha*op(S)*x
  initial state of Y  is ignored (rewritten without initial multiplication
  by zeros).

NOTE: this function throws exception when called for non-CRS/SKS  matrix.
You must convert your matrix with SparseConvertToCRS/SKS()  before  using
this function.

For CRS-bases storage format:
* this function can be called ONLY DURING MATRIX INITIALIZATION
* zero values are stored in the matrix similarly to non-zero ones
* elements must be initialized in correct order -  from top row to bottom,

                    NAN's or INF's.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS
    X           -   array[N], inv(op(S))*x

NOTE: this function throws exception when called for  non-CRS/SKS  matrix.
      You must convert your matrix  with  SparseConvertToCRS/SKS()  before
      using this function.

NOTE: no assertion or tests are done during algorithm  operation.   It  is
      your responsibility to provide invertible matrix to algorithm.

copying  Y[first_point]  (corresponds  to the leftmost,  minimal  X[])  to
Y[last_point]. However it is recommended to pass consistent values of Y[],
i.e. to make Y[first_point]=Y[last_point].

This function solves following problem: given table y[] of function values

However, this subroutine doesn't require you to specify equal  values  for
the first and last points - it automatically forces them  to  be  equal by
copying  Y[first_point]  (corresponds  to the leftmost,  minimal  X[])  to
Y[last_point]. However it is recommended to pass consistent values of Y[],
i.e. to make Y[first_point]=Y[last_point].

Fitting by smoothing (penalized) cubic spline.

This function approximates N scattered points (some of X[] may be equal to
each other) by cubic spline with M  nodes  at  equidistant  grid  spanning
interval [min(x,xc),max(x,xc)].

The problem is regularized by adding nonlinearity penalty to  usual  least
squares penalty function:

    MERIT_FUNC = F_LS + F_NL

where F_LS is a least squares error  term,  and  F_NL  is  a  nonlinearity
penalty which is roughly proportional to LambdaNS*integral{ S''(x)^2*dx }.
Algorithm applies automatic renormalization of F_NL  which  makes  penalty
term roughly invariant to scaling of X[] and changes in M.

This function is a new edition  of  penalized  regression  spline fitting,
a fast and compact one which needs much less resources that  its  previous
version: just O(maxMN) memory and O(maxMN*log(maxMN)) time.

NOTE: it is OK to run this function with both M&lt;&lt;N and M&gt;&gt;N;  say,  it  is
      possible to process 100 points with 1000-node spline.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    X           -   points, array[0..N-1].
    Y           -   function values, array[0..N-1].
    N           -   number of points (optional):
                    * N&gt;0
                    * if given, only first N elements of X/Y are processed
                    * if not given, automatically determined from lengths
    M           -   number of basis functions ( = number_of_nodes), M&gt;=4.
    LambdaNS    -   LambdaNS&gt;=0, regularization  constant  passed by user.
                    It penalizes nonlinearity in the regression spline.
                    Possible values to start from are 0.00001, 0.1, 1

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    S   -   spline interpolant.
    Rep -   Following fields are set:
            * RMSError      rms error on the (X,Y).
            * AvgError      average error on the (X,Y).
            * AvgRelError   average relative error on the non-zero Y
            * MaxError      maximum error

ORDER OF POINTS

Subroutine automatically sorts points, so caller may pass unsorted array.
Derivative values are correctly reordered on return, so  D[I]  is  always
equal to S'(X[I]) independently of points order.

SETTING BOUNDARY VALUES:

The BoundLType/BoundRType parameters can have the following values:
    * -1, which corresonds to the periodic (cyclic) boundary conditions.
          In this case:
          * both BoundLType and BoundRType must be equal to -1.
          * BoundL/BoundR are ignored
          * Y[last] is ignored (it is assumed to be equal to Y[first]).
    *  0, which  corresponds  to  the  parabolically   terminated  spline
          (BoundL and/or BoundR are ignored).
    *  1, which corresponds to the first derivative boundary condition
    *  2, which corresponds to the second derivative boundary condition
    *  by default, BoundType=0 is used

PROBLEMS WITH PERIODIC BOUNDARY CONDITIONS:

Problems with periodic boundary conditions have Y[first_point]=Y[last_point].
However, this subroutine doesn't require you to specify equal  values  for
the first and last points - it automatically forces them  to  be  equal by
copying  Y[first_point]  (corresponds  to the leftmost,  minimal  X[])  to
Y[last_point]. However it is recommended to pass consistent values of Y[],
i.e. to make Y[first_point]=Y[last_point].

  * spline2dbuildersetarea()     - for user-defined area

* prior term is chosen with one of the following functions:
  * spline2dbuildersetlinterm()   to set linear prior
  * spline2dbuildersetconstterm() to set constant prior
  * spline2dbuildersetzeroterm()  to set zero prior
  * spline2dbuildersetuserterm()  to set user-defined constant prior

least squares fitting  with  fast  sparse  direct  solver,  with  optional
nonsmoothness penalty being applied.

Nonlinearity penalty has the following form:

                          [                                            ]

here integral is calculated over entire grid, and &quot;~&quot; means &quot;proportional&quot;
because integral is normalized after calcilation. Extremely  large  values
of Lambda result in linear fit being performed.

NOTE: this algorithm is the most robust and controllable one,  but  it  is
      limited by 512x512 grids and (say) up to 1.000.000 points.  However,
      ALGLIB has one more  spline  solver:  FastDDM  algorithm,  which  is
      intended for really large-scale problems (in 10M-100M range). FastDDM
      algorithm also has better parallelism properties.

More information on BlockLLS solver:
* memory requirements: ~[32*K^3+256*NPoints]  bytes  for  KxK  grid   with
  NPoints-sized dataset
* serial running time: O(K^4+NPoints)
* parallelism potential: limited. You may get some sublinear gain when
  working with large grids (K's in 256..512 range)

This  function  allows  you to choose least squares solver used to perform
fitting. This function sets solver algorithm to &quot;FastDDM&quot;, which  performs
fast parallel fitting by splitting problem into smaller chunks and merging
results together.

This solver is optimized for large-scale problems, starting  from  256x256
grids, and up to 10000x10000 grids. Of course, it will  work  for  smaller
grids too.

More detailed description of the algorithm is given below:
* algorithm generates hierarchy  of  nested  grids,  ranging  from  ~16x16
  (topmost &quot;layer&quot; of the model) to ~KX*KY one (final layer). Upper layers
  model global behavior of the function, lower layers are  used  to  model
  fine details. Moving from layer to layer doubles grid density.
* fitting  is  started  from  topmost  layer, subsequent layers are fitted
  using residuals from previous ones.
* user may choose to skip generation of upper layers and generate  only  a
  few bottom ones, which  will  result  in  much  better  performance  and
  parallelization efficiency, at the cost of algorithm inability to &quot;patch&quot;
  large holes in the dataset.
* every layer is regularized using progressively increasing regularization
  coefficient; thus, increasing  LambdaV  penalizes  fine  details  first,
  leaving lower frequencies almost intact for a while.
* after fitting is done, all layers are merged together into  one  bicubic
  spline

IMPORTANT: regularization coefficient used by  this  solver  is  different
           from the one used by  BlockLLS.  Latter  utilizes  nonlinearity
           penalty,  which  is  global  in  nature  (large  regularization
           results in global linear trend being  extracted);  this  solver
           uses another, localized form of penalty, which is suitable  for
           parallel processing.

Notes on memory and performance:
* memory requirements: most memory is consumed  during  modeling   of  the
  higher layers; ~[512*NPoints] bytes is required for a  model  with  full
  hierarchy of grids being generated. However, if you skip a  few  topmost
  layers, you will get nearly constant (wrt. points count and  grid  size)
  memory consumption.
* serial running time: O(K*K)+O(NPoints) for a KxK grid
* parallelism potential: good. You may get  nearly  linear  speed-up  when
  performing fitting with just a few layers. Adding more layers results in
  model becoming more global, which somewhat  reduces  efficiency  of  the
  parallel code.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    S       -   spline 2D builder object
    NLayers -   number of layers in the model:
                * NLayers&gt;=1 means that up  to  chosen  number  of  bottom
                  layers is fitted
                * NLayers=0 means that maximum number of layers is  chosen
                  (according to current grid size)
                * NLayers&lt;=-1 means that up to |NLayers| topmost layers is

                Recommendations:
                * good &quot;default&quot; value is 2 layers
                * you may need  more  layers,  if  your  dataset  is  very
                  irregular and you want to &quot;patch&quot;  large  holes.  For  a
                  grid step H (equal to AreaWidth/GridSize) you may expect
                  that last layer reproduces variations at distance H (and
                  can patch holes that wide); that higher  layers  operate
                  at distances 2*H, 4*H, 8*H and so on.
                * good value for &quot;bullletproof&quot; mode is  NLayers=0,  which
                  results in complete hierarchy of layers being generated.
    LambdaV -   regularization coefficient, chosen in such a way  that  it
                penalizes bottom layers (fine details) first.

This  function  allows  you to choose least squares solver used to perform
fitting. This function sets solver algorithm to &quot;NaiveLLS&quot;.

IMPORTANT: NaiveLLS is NOT intended to be used in  real  life  code!  This
           algorithm solves problem by generated dense (K^2)x(K^2+NPoints)
           matrix and solves  linear  least  squares  problem  with  dense
           solver.

           It is here just  to  test  BlockLLS  against  reference  solver
           (and maybe for someone trying to compare well optimized  solver
           against straightforward approach to the LLS problem).

More information on naive LLS solver:
* memory requirements: ~[8*K^4+256*NPoints] bytes for KxK grid.
* serial running time: O(K^6+NPoints) for KxK grid
* when compared with BlockLLS,  NaiveLLS  has ~K  larger memory demand and
  ~K^2  larger running time.

This function serializes data structure to string.

Important properties of s_out:
* it contains alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, minus signs
* these symbols are grouped into words, which are separated by spaces
  and Windows-style (CR+LF) newlines
* although  serializer  uses  spaces and CR+LF as separators, you can 
  replace any separator character by arbitrary combination of spaces,
  tabs, Windows or Unix newlines. It allows flexible reformatting  of
  the  string  in  case you want to include it into text or XML file. 
  But you should not insert separators into the middle of the &quot;words&quot;
  nor you should change case of letters.
* s_out can be freely moved between 32-bit and 64-bit systems, little
  and big endian machines, and so on. You can serialize structure  on
  32-bit machine and unserialize it on 64-bit one (or vice versa), or
  serialize  it  on  SPARC  and  unserialize  on  x86.  You  can also

This function adds data sequence to SSA  model.  Only   single-dimensional
sequences are supported.

What is a sequences? Following definitions/requirements apply:
* a sequence  is  an  array of  values  measured  in  subsequent,  equally
  separated time moments (ticks).
* you may have many sequences  in your  dataset;  say,  one  sequence  may
  correspond to one trading session.
* sequence length should be larger  than current  window  length  (shorter
  sequences will be ignored during analysis).
* analysis is performed within a  sequence; different  sequences  are  NOT
  stacked together to produce one large contiguous stream of data.
* analysis is performed for all  sequences at once, i.e. same set of basis
  vectors is computed for all sequences

INCREMENTAL ANALYSIS

This function is non intended for  incremental updates of previously found
SSA basis. Calling it invalidates  all previous analysis results (basis is
reset and will be recalculated from zero during next analysis).

If  you  want  to  perform   incremental/real-time  SSA,  consider   using
following functions:
* ssaappendpointandupdate() for appending one point
* ssaappendsequenceandupdate() for appending new sequence

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    S               -   SSA model created with ssacreate()
    X               -   array[N], data, can be larger (additional values
                        are ignored)
    N               -   data length, can be automatically determined from
                        the array length. N&gt;=0.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    S               -   SSA model, updated

NOTE: you can clear dataset with ssacleardata()

This function:
* builds SSA basis using internally stored (entire) dataset
* returns reconstruction for the last NTicks of the last sequence

If you want to analyze some other sequence, use ssaanalyzesequence().

Reconstruction phase involves  generation  of  NTicks-WindowWidth  sliding
windows, their decomposition using empirical orthogonal functions found by
SSA, followed by averaging of each data point across  several  overlapping
windows. Thus, every point in the output trend is reconstructed  using  up
to WindowWidth overlapping  windows  (WindowWidth windows exactly  in  the
inner points, just one window at the extremal points).

IMPORTANT: due to averaging this function returns  different  results  for
           different values of NTicks. It is expected and not a bug.

           For example:
           * Trend[NTicks-1] is always same because it is not averaged  in
             any case (same applies to Trend[0]).
           * Trend[NTicks-2] has different values  for  NTicks=WindowWidth
             and NTicks=WindowWidth+1 because former  case  means that  no
             averaging is performed, and latter  case means that averaging
             using two sliding windows  is  performed.  Larger  values  of
             NTicks produce same results as NTicks=WindowWidth+1.
           * ...and so on...

PERFORMANCE: this  function has O((NTicks-WindowWidth)*WindowWidth*NBasis)
             running time. If you work  in  time-constrained  setting  and
             have to analyze just a few last ticks, choosing NTicks  equal
             to WindowWidth+SmoothingLen, with SmoothingLen=1...WindowWidth
             will result in good compromise between noise cancellation and
             analysis speed.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    S               -   SSA model
    NTicks          -   number of ticks to analyze, Nticks&gt;=1.
                        * special case of NTicks&lt;=WindowWidth  is  handled
                          by analyzing last window and  returning   NTicks
                          last ticks.
                        * special case NTicks&gt;LastSequenceLen  is  handled
                          by prepending result with NTicks-LastSequenceLen
                          zeros.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    Trend           -   array[NTicks], reconstructed trend line
    Noise           -   array[NTicks], the rest of the signal;
                        it holds that ActualData = Trend+Noise.


CACHING/REUSE OF THE BASIS

Caching/reuse of previous results is performed:
* first call performs full run of SSA; basis is stored in the cache
* subsequent calls reuse previously cached basis
* if you call any function which changes model properties (window  length,
  algorithm, dataset), internal basis will be invalidated.
* the only calls which do NOT invalidate basis are listed below:
  a) ssasetwindow() with same window length
  b) ssaappendpointandupdate()
  c) ssaappendsequenceandupdate()
  d) ssasetalgotopk...() with exactly same K
  Calling these functions will result in reuse of previously found basis.

In  any  case,  only  basis  is  reused. Reconstruction is performed  from
scratch every time you call this function.


HANDLING OF DEGENERATE CASES

Following degenerate cases may happen:
* dataset is empty (no analysis can be done)
* all sequences are shorter than the window length,no analysis can be done
* no algorithm is specified (no analysis can be done)
* last sequence is shorter than the window length (analysis  can  be done,
  but we can not perform reconstruction on the last sequence)

Calling this function in degenerate cases returns following result:
* in any case, NTicks ticks is returned
* trend is assumed to be zero
* noise is initialized by the last sequence; if last sequence  is  shorter
  than the window size, it is moved to  the  end  of  the  array, and  the
  beginning of the noise array is filled by zeros

No analysis is performed in degenerate cases (we immediately return  dummy
values, no basis is constructed).

This  function  executes  SSA  on  internally  stored  dataset and returns
analysis  for  the  last  window  of  the  last sequence. Such analysis is
an lightweight alternative for full scale reconstruction (see below).

Typical use case for this function is  real-time  setting,  when  you  are
interested in quick-and-dirty (very quick and very  dirty)  processing  of
just a few last ticks of the trend.

IMPORTANT: full  scale  SSA  involves  analysis  of  the  ENTIRE  dataset,
           with reconstruction being done for  all  positions  of  sliding
           window with subsequent hankelization  (diagonal  averaging)  of
           the resulting matrix.

           Such analysis requires O((DataLen-Window)*Window*NBasis)  FLOPs
           and can be quite costly. However, it has  nice  noise-canceling
           effects due to averaging.

           This function performs REDUCED analysis of the last window.  It
           is much faster - just O(Window*NBasis),  but  its  results  are
           DIFFERENT from that of ssaanalyzelast(). In  particular,  first
           few points of the trend are much more prone to noise.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    S               -   SSA model

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    Trend           -   array[WindowSize], reconstructed trend line
    Noise           -   array[WindowSize], the rest of the signal;
                        it holds that ActualData = Trend+Noise.
    NTicks          -   current WindowSize


CACHING/REUSE OF THE BASIS

    Noise           -   array[NTicks], the rest of the signal;
                        it holds that ActualData = Trend+Noise.


CACHING/REUSE OF THE BASIS

Caching/reuse of previous results is performed:
* first call performs full run of SSA; basis is stored in the cache
* subsequent calls reuse previously cached basis
* if you call any function which changes model properties (window  length,
  algorithm, dataset), internal basis will be invalidated.
* the only calls which do NOT invalidate basis are listed below:
  a) ssasetwindow() with same window length
  b) ssaappendpointandupdate()
  c) ssaappendsequenceandupdate()
  d) ssasetalgotopk...() with exactly same K
  Calling these functions will result in reuse of previously found basis.

In  any  case,  only  basis  is  reused. Reconstruction is performed  from
scratch every time you call this function.


HANDLING OF DEGENERATE CASES

Following degenerate cases may happen:
* dataset is empty (no analysis can be done)
* all sequences are shorter than the window length,no analysis can be done
* no algorithm is specified (no analysis can be done)
* sequence being passed is shorter than the window length

Calling this function in degenerate cases returns following result:
* in any case, NTicks ticks is returned
* trend is assumed to be zero
* noise is initialized by the sequence.

No analysis is performed in degenerate cases (we immediately return  dummy
values, no basis is constructed).

* if you want to add M points to the same sequence, perform M-1 calls with

Running time of this function does NOT depend on  dataset  size,  only  on

      However, if  you  have  several  SSA  models  which  are  calculated
      simultaneously, and if you want to reduce computational  bottlenecks
      by performing random updates at random moments, then fixed  seed  is
      not an option - all updates will fire at same moments.

      You may change it with ssasetseed() function.

This function creates SSA model object.  Right after creation model is  in
&quot;dummy&quot; mode - you can add data,  but   analyzing/prediction  will  return
just zeros (it assumes that basis is empty).

HOW TO USE SSA MODEL:

1. create model with ssacreate()
2. add data with one/many ssaaddsequence() calls
3. choose SSA algorithm with one of ssasetalgo...() functions:
   * ssasetalgotopkdirect() for direct one-run analysis
   * ssasetalgotopkrealtime() for algorithm optimized for many  subsequent
     runs with warm-start capabilities
   * ssasetalgoprecomputed() for user-supplied basis
4. set window width with ssasetwindow()
5. perform one of the analysis-related activities:
   a) call ssagetbasis() to get basis
   b) call ssaanalyzelast() ssaanalyzesequence() or ssaanalyzelastwindow()
      to perform analysis (trend/noise separation)
   c) call  one  of   the   forecasting   functions  (ssaforecastlast() or
      ssaforecastsequence()) to perform prediction; alternatively, you can
      extract linear recurrence coefficients with ssagetlrr().
   SSA analysis will be performed during first  call  to  analysis-related
   function. SSA model is smart enough to track all changes in the dataset
   and  model  settings,  to  cache  previously  computed  basis  and   to
   re-evaluate basis only when necessary.

Additionally, if your setting involves constant stream  of  incoming data,
you can perform quick update already calculated  model  with  one  of  the
incremental   append-and-update   functions:  ssaappendpointandupdate() or
ssaappendsequenceandupdate().

NOTE: steps (2), (3), (4) can be performed in arbitrary order.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    none

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    S               -   structure which stores model state

This function builds SSA basis and performs forecasting  for  a  specified
number of ticks, returning value of trend.

Forecast is performed as follows:
* SSA  trend  extraction  is  applied to last  M  sliding windows  of  the
  internally stored dataset
* for each of M sliding windows, M predictions are built
* average value of M predictions is returned

This function has following running time:
* O(NBasis*WindowWidth*M) for trend extraction phase (always performed)
* O(WindowWidth*NTicks*M) for forecast phase

NOTE: noise reduction is ALWAYS applied by this algorithm; if you want  to
      apply recurrence relation  to  raw  unprocessed  data,  use  another
      function - ssaforecastsequence() which allows to  turn  on  and  off
      noise reduction phase.

NOTE: combination of several predictions results in lesser sensitivity  to
      noise, but it may produce undesirable discontinuities  between  last
      point of the trend and first point of the prediction. The reason  is
      that  last  point  of  the  trend is usually corrupted by noise, but
      average  value of  several  predictions  is less sensitive to noise,
      thus discontinuity appears. It is not a bug.

INPUT PARAMETERS:

CACHING/REUSE OF THE BASIS

Caching/reuse of previous results is performed:

* subsequent calls reuse previously cached basis
* if you call any function which changes model properties (window  length,
  algorithm, dataset), internal basis will be invalidated.
* the only calls which do NOT invalidate basis are listed below:
  a) ssasetwindow() with same window length
  b) ssaappendpointandupdate()
  c) ssaappendsequenceandupdate()
  d) ssasetalgotopk...() with exactly same K
  Calling these functions will result in reuse of previously found basis.


HANDLING OF DEGENERATE CASES

Following degenerate cases may happen:
* dataset is empty (no analysis can be done)
* all sequences are shorter than the window length,no analysis can be done
* no algorithm is specified (no analysis can be done)
* last sequence is shorter than the WindowWidth   (analysis  can  be done,
  but we can not perform forecasting on the last sequence)

* SSA analysis algorithm is  configured  to  extract  basis  whose size is
  equal to window length (impossible to use for  forecasting;  only  basis
  whose size is less than window length can be used).

Calling this function in degenerate cases returns following result:
* NTicks  copies  of  the  last  value is returned for non-empty task with
  large enough dataset, but with overcomplete  basis  (window  width=1  or
  basis size is equal to window width)
* zero trend with length=NTicks is returned for empty task

No analysis is performed in degenerate cases (we immediately return  dummy

NOTE: this algorithm performs prediction using only one - last  -  sliding
      window.  Predictions  produced   by   such   approach   are   smooth
      continuations of the reconstructed  trend  line,  but  they  can  be
      easily corrupted by noise. If you need  noise-resistant  prediction,
      use ssaforecastavglast() function, which averages predictions  built
      using several sliding windows.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    S               -   SSA model
    NTicks          -   number of ticks to forecast, NTicks&gt;=1

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    Trend           -   array[NTicks], predicted trend line


CACHING/REUSE OF THE BASIS

Caching/reuse of previous results is performed:
* first call performs full run of SSA; basis is stored in the cache
* subsequent calls reuse previously cached basis
* if you call any function which changes model properties (window  length,
  algorithm, dataset), internal basis will be invalidated.
* the only calls which do NOT invalidate basis are listed below:
  a) ssasetwindow() with same window length
  b) ssaappendpointandupdate()
  c) ssaappendsequenceandupdate()
  d) ssasetalgotopk...() with exactly same K
  Calling these functions will result in reuse of previously found basis.


HANDLING OF DEGENERATE CASES

Following degenerate cases may happen:
* dataset is empty (no analysis can be done)
* all sequences are shorter than the window length,no analysis can be done
* no algorithm is specified (no analysis can be done)
* last sequence is shorter than the WindowWidth   (analysis  can  be done,
  but we can not perform forecasting on the last sequence)
* window lentgh is 1 (impossible to use for forecasting)
* SSA analysis algorithm is  configured  to  extract  basis  whose size is
  equal to window length (impossible to use for  forecasting;  only  basis
  whose size is less than window length can be used).

Calling this function in degenerate cases returns following result:
* NTicks  copies  of  the  last  value is returned for non-empty task with
  large enough dataset, but with overcomplete  basis  (window  width=1  or
  basis size is equal to window width)
* zero trend with length=NTicks is returned for empty task

No analysis is performed in degenerate cases (we immediately return  dummy
values, no basis is ever constructed).

This function builds SSA  basis  and  performs  forecasting  for  a  user-

Forecasting is done in two stages:

  sequence. This stage is optional, you  can  turn  it  off  if  you  pass
  data which are already processed with SSA. Of course, you  can  turn  it
  off even for raw data, but it is not recommended - noise suppression  is
  very important for correct prediction.
* then, we apply LRR for last  WindowWidth-1  elements  of  the  extracted
  trend.

This function has following running time:
* O(NBasis*WindowWidth) for trend extraction phase
* O(WindowWidth*NTicks) for forecast phase

  window width AFTER you call analysis-related  function,  next  analysis
  phase will require re-calculation of  the  basis  according  to  current
  algorithm.
* calling this function with exactly  same window width as current one has
  no effect
* if you specify window width larger  than any data sequence stored in the
  model, analysis will return zero basis.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    S               -   SSA model created with ssacreate()
    WindowWidth     -   &gt;=1, new window width

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    S               -   SSA model, updated

Sign test

This test checks three hypotheses about the median of  the  given  sample.
The following tests are performed:
    * two-tailed test (null hypothesis - the median is equal to the  given
      value)
    * left-tailed test (null hypothesis - the median is  greater  than  or
      equal to the given value)
    * right-tailed test (null hypothesis - the  median  is  less  than  or
      equal to the given value)

Requirements:
    * the scale of measurement should be ordinal, interval or ratio  (i.e.
      the test could not be applied to nominal variables).

The test is non-parametric and doesn't require distribution X to be normal

Input parameters:
    X       -   sample. Array whose index goes from 0 to N-1.
    N       -   size of the sample.
    Median  -   assumed median value.

Output parameters:
    BothTails   -   p-value for two-tailed test.
                    If BothTails is less than the given significance level
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
    LeftTail    -   p-value for left-tailed test.
                    If LeftTail is less than the given significance level,
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
    RightTail   -   p-value for right-tailed test.
                    If RightTail is less than the given significance level
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.

While   calculating   p-values   high-precision   binomial    distribution
approximation is used, so significance levels have about 15 exact digits.

Relation to incomplete beta integral:

       1 - stdtr(k,t) = 0.5 * incbet( k/2, 1/2, z )
where
       z = k/(k + t**2).

For t &lt; -2, this is the method of computation.  For higher t,
a direct method is derived from integration by parts.
Since the function is symmetric about t=0, the area under the
right tail of the density is found by calling the function
with -t instead of t.

One-sample t-test

This test checks three hypotheses about the mean of the given sample.  The
following tests are performed:
    * two-tailed test (null hypothesis - the mean is equal  to  the  given
      value)
    * left-tailed test (null hypothesis - the  mean  is  greater  than  or
      equal to the given value)
    * right-tailed test (null hypothesis - the mean is less than or  equal
      to the given value).

The test is based on the assumption that  a  given  sample  has  a  normal
distribution and  an  unknown  dispersion.  If  the  distribution  sharply
differs from normal, the test will work incorrectly.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    X       -   sample. Array whose index goes from 0 to N-1.
    N       -   size of sample, N&gt;=0
    Mean    -   assumed value of the mean.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    BothTails   -   p-value for two-tailed test.
                    If BothTails is less than the given significance level
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
    LeftTail    -   p-value for left-tailed test.
                    If LeftTail is less than the given significance level,
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
    RightTail   -   p-value for right-tailed test.
                    If RightTail is less than the given significance level
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.

NOTE: this function correctly handles degenerate cases:
      * when N=0, all p-values are set to 1.0
      * when variance of X[] is exactly zero, p-values are set
        to 1.0 or 0.0, depending on difference between sample mean and
        value of mean being tested.

Singular value decomposition of a rectangular matrix.

  ! COMMERCIAL EDITION OF ALGLIB:
  !
  ! Commercial Edition of ALGLIB includes following important improvements
  ! of this function:
  ! * high-performance native backend with same C# interface (C# version)
  ! * hardware vendor (Intel) implementations of linear algebra primitives
  !   (C++ and C# versions, x86/x64 platform)
  !

The algorithm calculates the singular value decomposition of a matrix of
size MxN: A = U * S * V^T

The algorithm finds the singular values and, optionally, matrices U and V^T.
The algorithm can find both first min(M,N) columns of matrix U and rows of
matrix V^T (singular vectors), and matrices U and V^T wholly (of sizes MxM
and NxN respectively).

Take into account that the subroutine does not return matrix V but V^T.

Input parameters:
    A           -   matrix to be decomposed.
                    Array whose indexes range within [0..M-1, 0..N-1].
    M           -   number of rows in matrix A.
    N           -   number of columns in matrix A.
    UNeeded     -   0, 1 or 2. See the description of the parameter U.
    VTNeeded    -   0, 1 or 2. See the description of the parameter VT.
    AdditionalMemory -
                    If the parameter:
                     * equals 0, the algorithm doesn't use additional
                       memory (lower requirements, lower performance).
                     * equals 1, the algorithm uses additional
                       memory of size min(M,N)*min(M,N) of real numbers.
                       It often speeds up the algorithm.
                     * equals 2, the algorithm uses additional
                       memory of size M*min(M,N) of real numbers.
                       It allows to get a maximum performance.
                    The recommended value of the parameter is 2.

Output parameters:
    W           -   contains singular values in descending order.
    U           -   if UNeeded=0, U isn't changed, the left singular vectors
                    are not calculated.
                    if Uneeded=1, U contains left singular vectors (first
                    min(M,N) columns of matrix U). Array whose indexes range
                    within [0..M-1, 0..Min(M,N)-1].
                    if UNeeded=2, U contains matrix U wholly. Array whose
                    indexes range within [0..M-1, 0..M-1].
    VT          -   if VTNeeded=0, VT isn't changed, the right singular vectors
                    are not calculated.
                    if VTNeeded=1, VT contains right singular vectors (first
                    min(M,N) rows of matrix V^T). Array whose indexes range
                    within [0..min(M,N)-1, 0..N-1].
                    if VTNeeded=2, VT contains matrix V^T wholly. Array whose
                    indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..N-1].

Sparse Cholesky decomposition for skyline matrixm using in-place algorithm
without allocating additional storage.

The algorithm computes Cholesky decomposition  of  a  symmetric  positive-
definite sparse matrix. The result of an algorithm is a representation  of
A as A=U^T*U or A=L*L^T

This  function  is  a  more  efficient alternative to general, but  slower
SparseCholeskyX(), because it does not  create  temporary  copies  of  the
target. It performs factorization in-place, which gives  best  performance
on low-profile matrices. Its drawback, however, is that it can not perform
profile-reducing permutation of input matrix.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    A       -   sparse matrix in skyline storage (SKS) format.
    N       -   size of matrix A (can be smaller than actual size of A)
    IsUpper -   if IsUpper=True, then factorization is performed on  upper
                triangle. Another triangle is ignored (it may contant some
                data, but it is not changed).


OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    A       -   the result of factorization, stored in SKS. If IsUpper=True,
                then the upper  triangle  contains  matrix  U,  such  that
                A = U^T*U. Lower triangle is not changed.
                Similarly, if IsUpper = False. In this case L is returned,
                and we have A = L*(L^T).
                Note that THIS function does not  perform  permutation  of
                rows to reduce bandwidth.

RESULT:
    If  the  matrix  is  positive-definite,  the  function  returns  True.
    Otherwise, the function returns False. Contents of A is not determined
    in such case.

NOTE: for  performance  reasons  this  function  does NOT check that input
      matrix  includes  only  finite  values. It is your responsibility to
      make sure that there are no infinite or NAN values in the matrix.

Sparse LU decomposition with column pivoting for sparsity and row pivoting
for stability. Input must be square sparse matrix stored in CRS format.

The algorithm  computes  LU  decomposition  of  a  general  square  matrix
(rectangular ones are not supported). The result  of  an  algorithm  is  a
representation of A as A = P*L*U*Q, where:
* L is lower unitriangular matrix
* U is upper triangular matrix
* P = P0*P1*...*PK, K=N-1, Pi - permutation matrix for I and P[I]
* Q = QK*...*Q1*Q0, K=N-1, Qi - permutation matrix for I and Q[I]

This function pivots columns for higher sparsity, and then pivots rows for
stability (larger element at the diagonal).

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    A       -   sparse NxN matrix in CRS format. An exception is generated
                if matrix is non-CRS or non-square.
    PivotType-  pivoting strategy:
                * 0 for best pivoting available (2 in current version)
                * 1 for row-only pivoting (NOT RECOMMENDED)
                * 2 for complete pivoting which produces most sparse outputs

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    A       -   the result of factorization, matrices L and U stored in
                compact form using CRS sparse storage format:
                * lower unitriangular L is stored strictly under main diagonal
                * upper triangilar U is stored ON and ABOVE main diagonal
    P       -   row permutation matrix in compact form, array[N]
    Q       -   col permutation matrix in compact form, array[N]

This function always succeeds, i.e. it ALWAYS returns valid factorization,
but for your convenience it also returns  boolean  value  which  helps  to
detect symbolically degenerate matrices:
* function returns TRUE, if the matrix was factorized AND symbolically
  non-degenerate
* function returns FALSE, if the matrix was factorized but U has strictly
  zero elements at the diagonal (the factorization is returned anyway).

Update of Cholesky decomposition: &quot;fixing&quot; some variables.

This function uses internally allocated buffer which is not saved  between
subsequent  calls.  So,  if  you  perform  a lot  of  subsequent  updates,
we  recommend   you   to   use   &quot;buffered&quot;   version   of  this function:
SPDMatrixCholeskyUpdateFixBuf().

&quot;FIXING&quot; EXPLAINED:

    Suppose we have N*N positive definite matrix A. &quot;Fixing&quot; some variable
    means filling corresponding row/column of  A  by  zeros,  and  setting
    diagonal element to 1.

    For example, if we fix 2nd variable in 4*4 matrix A, it becomes Af:

        ( A00  A01  A02  A03 )      ( Af00  0   Af02 Af03 )
        ( A10  A11  A12  A13 )      (  0    1    0    0   )
        ( A20  A21  A22  A23 )  =&gt;  ( Af20  0   Af22 Af23 )
        ( A30  A31  A32  A33 )      ( Af30  0   Af32 Af33 )

    If we have Cholesky decomposition of A, it must be recalculated  after
    variables were  fixed.  However,  it  is  possible  to  use  efficient
    algorithm, which needs O(K*N^2)  time  to  &quot;fix&quot;  K  variables,  given
    Cholesky decomposition of original, &quot;unfixed&quot; A.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    A       -   upper or lower Cholesky factor.
                array with elements [0..N-1, 0..N-1].
                Exception is thrown if array size is too small.
    N       -   size of matrix A, N&gt;0
    IsUpper -   if IsUpper=True, then A contains  upper  Cholesky  factor;
                otherwise A contains a lower one.
    Fix     -   array[N], I-th element is True if I-th  variable  must  be
                fixed. Exception is thrown if array size is too small.
    BufR    -   possibly preallocated  buffer;  automatically  resized  if
                needed. It is recommended to  reuse  this  buffer  if  you
                perform a lot of subsequent decompositions.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    A       -   updated factorization.  If  IsUpper=True,  then  the  upper
                triangle contains matrix U, and the elements below the main
                diagonal are not modified. Similarly, if IsUpper = False.

NOTE: this function always succeeds, so it does not return completion code

NOTE: this function checks sizes of input arrays, but it does  NOT  checks
      for presence of infinities or NAN's.

NOTE: this  function  is  efficient  only  for  moderate amount of updated
      variables - say, 0.1*N or 0.3*N. For larger amount of  variables  it
      will  still  work,  but  you  may  get   better   performance   with
      straightforward Cholesky.

Two-sample F-test

This test checks three hypotheses about dispersions of the given  samples.
The following tests are performed:
    * two-tailed test (null hypothesis - the dispersions are equal)
    * left-tailed test (null hypothesis  -  the  dispersion  of  the first
      sample is greater than or equal to  the  dispersion  of  the  second
      sample).
    * right-tailed test (null hypothesis - the  dispersion  of  the  first
      sample is less than or equal to the dispersion of the second sample)

The test is based on the following assumptions:
    * the given samples have normal distributions
    * the samples are independent.

Input parameters:
    X   -   sample 1. Array whose index goes from 0 to N-1.
    N   -   sample size.
    Y   -   sample 2. Array whose index goes from 0 to M-1.
    M   -   sample size.

Output parameters:
    BothTails   -   p-value for two-tailed test.
                    If BothTails is less than the given significance level
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
    LeftTail    -   p-value for left-tailed test.
                    If LeftTail is less than the given significance level,
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
    RightTail   -   p-value for right-tailed test.
                    If RightTail is less than the given significance level
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.

Wilcoxon signed-rank test

This test checks three hypotheses about the median  of  the  given sample.
The following tests are performed:
    * two-tailed test (null hypothesis - the median is equal to the  given
      value)
    * left-tailed test (null hypothesis - the median is  greater  than  or
      equal to the given value)
    * right-tailed test (null hypothesis  -  the  median  is  less than or
      equal to the given value)

Requirements:
    * the scale of measurement should be ordinal, interval or  ratio (i.e.
      the test could not be applied to nominal variables).
    * the distribution should be continuous and symmetric relative to  its
      median.
    * number of distinct values in the X array should be greater than 4

The test is non-parametric and doesn't require distribution X to be normal

Input parameters:
    X       -   sample. Array whose index goes from 0 to N-1.
    N       -   size of the sample.
    Median  -   assumed median value.

Output parameters:
    BothTails   -   p-value for two-tailed test.
                    If BothTails is less than the given significance level
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
    LeftTail    -   p-value for left-tailed test.
                    If LeftTail is less than the given significance level,
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
    RightTail   -   p-value for right-tailed test.
                    If RightTail is less than the given significance level
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.

To calculate p-values, special approximation is used. This method lets  us
calculate p-values with two decimal places in interval [0.0001, 1].

&quot;Two decimal places&quot; does not sound very impressive, but in  practice  the
relative error of less than 1% is enough to make a decision.

There is no approximation outside the [0.0001, 1] interval. Therefore,  if
the significance level outlies this interval, the test returns 0.0001.
